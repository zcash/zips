Terminology
===========

The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", and \"MAY\" in this document are
to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [^1]

\"Jubjub\" refers to the elliptic curve defined in[^2] section 5.4.8.3.

Abstract
========

This proposal defines a mechanism for extending hierarchical
deterministic wallets, as decribed in BIP 32 [^3], to support Zcash\'s
shielded addresses.

The specification has three parts. The first part defines a system for
deriving a tree of Sapling key components from a single seed. The second
part defines an equivalent, but independent, system for Sprout key
components (which have a different internal construction). The third
part shows how to use these trees in the context of existing BIP 44[^4]
wallets.

This specification complements the existing use by some Zcash wallets of
BIP 32 and BIP 44 for transparent Zcash addresses, and is not intended
to deprecate that usage (privacy risks of using transparent addresses
notwithstanding).

Motivation
==========

BIP 32[^5] is the standard mechanism by which wallets for Bitcoin and
its derivatives (including Zcash\'s transparent addresses[^6]) generate
keys and addresses deterministically. This has several advantages over
random generation:

-   Wallets only need to store a single seed (particularly useful for
    hardware wallets).
-   A one-time backup of the seed (usually stored as a word phrase[^7])
    can be used to recover funds from all future addresses.
-   Keys are arranged into a tree of chains, enabling wallets to
    represent \"accounts\" or other high-level structures.
-   View authority or spend authority can be delegated independently for
    sub-trees without compromising the master seed.

At present, no such equivalent exists for Zcash\'s shielded addresses.
This is of particular concern for hardware wallets; all
currently-marketed devices only store a seed internally, and have
trained their users to only backup that seed. Given that the Sapling
upgrade will make it feasible to use hardware wallets with shielded
addresses, it is desirable to have a standard mechanism for deriving
them.

Conventions
===========

Most of the notation and functions used in this ZIP are defined in the
Sapling protocol specification [^8]. They are reproduced here for
convenience:

-   truncate~k~(*S*) means the sequence formed from the first *k*
    elements of *S*.
-   *a* \|\| *b* means the concatenation of sequences *a* then *b*.
-   \[*k*\] *P* means scalar multiplication of the elliptic curve point
    *P* by the scalar *k*.
-   LEOS2IP~l~(*S*) is the integer in range {0..2^l^-1} represented in
    little-endian order by the byte sequence *S* of length *l*/8.
-   I2LEBSP~l~(*k*) is the sequence of *l* bits representing *k* in
    little-endian order.
-   LEBS2OSP~l~(*B*) is defined as follows when *l* is a multiple of 8:
    convert each group of 8 bits in *B* to a byte value with the least
    significant bit first, and concatenate the resulting bytes in the
    same order as the groups.
-   repr~𝕁~(*P*) is the representation of the Jubjub elliptic curve
    point *P* as a bit sequence, defined in[^9] section 5.4.8.3.
-   BLAKE2b-256(*p*, *x*) refers to unkeyed BLAKE2b-256 in sequential
    mode, with an output digest length of 32 bytes, 16-byte
    personalization string *p*, and input *x*.
-   BLAKE2b-512(*p*, *x*) refers to unkeyed BLAKE2b-512 in sequential
    mode, with an output digest length of 64 bytes, 16-byte
    personalization string *p*, and input *x*.
-   PRF^expand^(*sk*, *t*) := BLAKE2b-512(\"Zcash\_ExpandSeed\", *sk*
    \|\| *t*)
-   ToScalar(*x*) := LEOS2IP~512~(*x*) (mod *r*~𝕁~), where *r*~𝕁~ is the
    order of the Jubjub large prime subgroup.
-   DiversifyHash(*d*) maps a diversifier *d* to a base point on the
    Jubjub elliptic curve, or to ⊥ if the diversifier is invalid. It is
    instantiated in[^10] section 5.4.1.6.

The following algorithm standardized in[^11] is used:

-   FF1-AES256.Encrypt(*key*, *tweak*, *x*) refers to the FF1 encryption
    algorithm using AES with a 256-bit *key*, and parameters *radix* =
    2, *minlen* = 88, *maxlen* = 88. It will be used only with the empty
    string \"\" as the *tweak*. *x* is a sequence of 88 bits, as is the
    output.

We also define the following conversion function:

-   I2LEOSP~l~(*k*) is the byte sequence *S* of length *l*/8
    representing in little-endian order the integer *k* in range
    {0..2^l^-1}. It is the reverse operation of LEOS2IP~l~(*S*).

Implementors should note that this ZIP is consistently little-endian (in
keeping with the Sapling specification), which is the opposite of BIP
32.

We adapt the path notation of BIP 32[^12] to describe shielded HD paths,
using apostrophes to indicate hardened derivation (i\' = i + 2^31^) as
in BIP 44[^13]:

-   CDKsk(CDKsk(CDKsk(m~Sprout~, a\'), b), c) is written as m~Sprout~ /
    a\' / b / c
-   CDKfvk(CDKfvk(CDKfvk(M~Sapling~, a), b), c) is written as M~Sapling~
    / a / b / c

Specification: Sapling key derivation
=====================================

Sapling extended keys
---------------------

BIP 32 defines a method to derive a number of child keys from a parent
key. In order to prevent these from depending solely on the parent key
itself, both the private and public keys are extended with a 32-byte
chain code. We similarly extend Sapling keys with a chain code here.
However, the concepts of \"private\" and \"public\" keys in BIP 32 do
not map cleanly to Sapling\'s key components. We take the following
approach:

-   We derive child Sapling expanded spending keys, rather than Sapling
    spending keys. This enables us to implement both hardened and
    non-hardened derivation modes (the latter being incompatible with
    Sapling spending keys).
-   We do not derive Sapling public keys directly, as this would prevent
    the use of diversified addresses. Instead, we derive Sapling full
    viewing keys, from which payment addresses can be generated. This
    maintains the trust semantics of BIP 32: someone with access to a
    BIP 32 extended public key is able to view all transactions
    involving that address, which a Sapling full viewing key also
    enables.

We represent a Sapling extended spending key as (*ask*, *nsk*, *ovk*,
*dk*, *c*), where (*ask*, *nsk*, *ovk*) is the normal Sapling expanded
spending key, *dk* is a diversifier key, and *c* is the chain code.

We represent a Sapling extended full viewing key as (*ak*, *nk*, *ovk*,
*dk*, *c*), where (*ak*, *nk*, *ovk*) is the normal Sapling full viewing
key, *dk* is the same diversifier key as above, and *c* is the chain
code.

Helper functions
----------------

Define EncodeExtSKParts(*ask*, *nsk*, *ovk*, *dk*) :=
I2LEOSP~256~(*ask*) \|\| I2LEOSP~256~(*nsk*) \|\| *ovk* \|\| *dk*.

Define EncodeExtFVKParts(*ak*, *nk*, *ovk*, *dk*) :=
LEBS2OSP~256~(repr~𝕁~(*ak*)) \|\| LEBS2OSP~256~(repr~𝕁~(*nk*)) \|\|
*ovk* \|\| *dk*.

Master key generation
---------------------

Let *S* be a seed byte sequence of a chosen length, which MUST be at
least 32 bytes.

-   Calculate *I* = BLAKE2b-512(\"ZcashIP32Sapling\", *S*).
-   Split *I* into two 32-byte sequences, *I*~L~ and *I*~R~.
-   Use *I*~L~ as the master spending key *sk*~m~, and *I*~R~ as the
    master chain code *c*~m~.
-   Calculate *ask*~m~, *nsk*~m~, and *ovk*~m~ via the standard Sapling
    derivation [^14]:
    -   *ask*~m~ = ToScalar(PRF^expand^(*sk*~m~, \[0x00\]))
    -   *nsk*~m~ = ToScalar(PRF^expand^(*sk*~m~, \[0x01\]))
    -   *ovk*~m~ = truncate~32~(PRF^expand^(*sk*~m~, \[0x02\]))
-   Calculate *dk*~m~ similarly:
    -   *dk*~m~ = truncate~32~(PRF^expand^(*sk*~m~, \[0x10\]))
-   Return (*ask*~m~, *nsk*~m~, *ovk*~m~, *dk*~m~, *c*~m~) as the master
    extended spending key *m*~Sapling~.

Child key derivation
--------------------

As in BIP 32, the method for deriving a child extended key, given a
parent extended key and an index *i*, depends on the type of key being
derived, and whether this is a hardened or non-hardened derivation.

### Deriving a child extended spending key

CDKsk((*ask*~par~, *nsk*~par~, *ovk*~par~, *dk*~par~, *c*~par~), *i*) →
(*ask*~i~, *nsk*~i~, *ovk*~i~, *dk*~i~, *c*~i~)

-   Check whether *i* ≥ 2^31^ (whether the child is a hardened key).
    -   If so (hardened child): let *I* = PRF^expand^(*c*~par~, \[0x11\]
        \|\| EncodeExtSKParts(*ask*~par~, *nsk*~par~, *ovk*~par~,
        *dk*~par~) \|\| I2LEOSP~32~(*i*))
    -   If not (normal child): let *I* = PRF^expand^(*c*~par~, \[0x12\]
        \|\| EncodeExtFVKParts(*ak*~par~, *nk*~par~, *ovk*~par~,
        *dk*~par~) \|\| I2LEOSP~32~(*i*)) where (*nk*~par~, *ak*~par~,
        *ovk*~par~) is the full viewing key derived from (*ask*~par~,
        *nsk*~par~, *ovk*~par~) as described in[^15].
-   Split *I* into two 32-byte sequences, *I*~L~ and *I*~R~.
-   Let *I*~ask~ = ToScalar(PRF^expand^(*I*~L~, \[0x13\]))
-   Let *I*~nsk~ = ToScalar(PRF^expand^(*I*~L~, \[0x14\]))
-   Return:
    -   *ask*~i~ = *I*~ask~ + *ask*~par~
    -   *nsk*~i~ = *I*~nsk~ + *nsk*~par~
    -   *ovk*~i~ = truncate~32~(PRF^expand^(*I*~L~, \[0x15\] \|\|
        *ovk*~par~))
    -   *dk*~i~ = truncate~32~(PRF^expand^(*I*~L~, \[0x16\] \|\|
        *dk*~par~))
    -   *c*~i~ = *I*~R~

### Deriving a child extended full viewing key

Let 𝓖 be as defined in[^16] section 5.4.6.1 and let 𝓗 be as defined
in[^17].

CDKfvk((*ak*~par~, *nk*~par~, *ovk*~par~, *dk*~par~, *c*~par~), *i*) →
(*ak*~i~, *nk*~i~, *ovk*~i~, *dk*~i~, *c*~i~)

-   Check whether *i* ≥ 2^31^ (whether the child is a hardened key).
    -   If so (hardened child): return failure
    -   If not (normal child): let *I* = PRF^expand^(*c*~par~, \[0x12\]
        \|\| EncodeExtFVKParts(*ak*~par~, *nk*~par~, *ovk*~par~,
        *dk*~par~) \|\| I2LEOSP~32~(*i*))
-   Split *I* into two 32-byte sequences, *I*~L~ and *I*~R~.
-   Let *I*~ask~ = ToScalar(PRF^expand^(*I*~L~, \[0x13\]))
-   Let *I*~nsk~ = ToScalar(PRF^expand^(*I*~L~, \[0x14\]))
-   Return:
    -   *ak*~i~ = \[*I*~ask~\] 𝓖 + *ak*~par~
    -   *nk*~i~ = \[*I*~nsk~\] 𝓗 + *nk*~par~
    -   *ovk*~i~ = truncate~32~(PRF^expand^(*I*~L~, \[0x15\] \|\|
        *ovk*~par~))
    -   *dk*~i~ = truncate~32~(PRF^expand^(*I*~L~, \[0x16\] \|\|
        *dk*~par~))
    -   *c*~i~ = *I*~R~

Diversifier derivation
----------------------

The 88-bit diversifiers for a Sapling extended key are derived from its
diversifier key *dk*. To prevent the diversifier leaking how many
diversified addresses have already been generated for an account, we
make the sequence of diversifiers pseudorandom and uncorrelated to that
of any other account. In order to reach the maximum possible diversifier
range without running into repetitions due to the birthday bound, we use
FF1-AES256 as a Pseudo-Random Permutation as follows:

-   Let *j* be the index of the desired diversifier, in the range 0 ..
    2^88^-1.
-   *d*~j~ = FF1-AES256.Encrypt(*dk*, \"\", I2LEBSP~88~(*j*)).

A valid diversifier *d*~j~ is one for which DiversifyHash(*d*~j~) ≠ ⊥.
For a given *dk*, approximately half of the possible values of *j* yield
valid diversifiers.

The default diversifier for a Sapling extended key is defined to be
*d*~j~, where *j* is the least nonnegative integer yielding a valid
diversifier.

Specification: Sprout key derivation
====================================

For completeness, we define a system for deriving a tree of Sprout key
components. It is unlikely that this will garner much usage once Sapling
activates, but is presented for those users who may require it.

Sprout extended keys
--------------------

Due to the way Sprout keys are constructed and used, it is not possible
to derive incoming viewing keys or payment addresses in parallel with
spending keys. Nor is it possible to implement non-hardened derivation.
We therefore only define and derive Sprout extended spending keys.

We represent a Sprout extended spending key as (*a*~sk~, *c*), where
*a*~sk~ is the normal Sprout spending key, and *c* is the chain code.

Helper functions
----------------

Let EncodeASK(*a*~sk~) be the 32-byte encoding of *a*~sk~ in the raw
encoding of a Sprout spending key (excluding lead bytes) as specified
in[^18] section 5.6.8.

Let DecodeASK(*ASK*) be the result of clearing the 4 most significant
bits of the first byte of *ASK*, and decoding the 32-byte result
according to the inverse of EncodeASK.

Master key generation
---------------------

Let *S* be a seed byte sequence of a chosen length, which MUST be at
least 32 bytes.

-   Calculate *I* = BLAKE2b-512(\"ZcashIP32\_Sprout\", *S*).
-   Split *I* into two 32-byte sequences, I~L~ and I~R~.
-   Use DecodeASK(*I*~L~) as the master spending key a~sk,m~.
-   Use *I*~R~ as the master chain code *c*~m~.

Child key derivation
--------------------

CDKsk((*a*~sk,par~, *c*~par~), *i*) → (*a*~sk,i~, *c*~i~)

-   Check whether *i* ≥ 2^31^ (whether the child is a hardened key).
    -   If so (hardened child): let *I* = PRF^expand^(*c*~par~, \[0x80\]
        \|\| EncodeASK(*a*~sk,par~) \|\| I2LEOSP~32~(*i*))
    -   If not (normal child): return failure
-   Split *I* into two 32-byte sequences, *I*~L~ and *I*~R~.
-   Use DecodeASK(*I*~L~) as the child spending key a~sk,i~.
-   Use *I*~R~ as the child chain code *c*~i~.

Specification: Wallet usage
===========================

Existing Zcash-supporting HD wallets all use BIP 44[^19] to organize
their derived keys. In order to more easily mesh with existing user
experiences, we broadly follow BIP 44\'s design here. However, we have
altered the design where it makes sense to leverage features of shielded
addresses.

Key path levels
---------------

Both Sprout and Sapling key paths have the following three path levels
at the top, all of which use hardened derivation:

-   `purpose`: a constant set to 32\' (or 0x80000020) following the BIP
    43 recommendation. It indicates that the subtree of this node is
    used according to this specification.
-   `coin_type`: a constant identifying the cybercoin that this
    subtree\'s keys are used with. For compatibility with existing BIP
    44 implementations, we use the same constants as defined in SLIP 44
    [^20]. Note that in keeping with that document, all cybercoin
    testnets share `coin_type` index 1.
-   `account`: numbered from index 0 in sequentially increasing manner.
    Defined as in BIP 44[^21].

Unlike BIP 44, neither Sprout nor Sapling have a change path level. The
use of change addresses in Bitcoin is a (failed) attempt to increase the
difficulty of tracking users on the transaction graph, by segregating
external and internal address usage. Shielded addresses are never
publicly visible in transactions, which means that sending change back
to the originating address is indistinguishable from using a change
address.

Sapling key path
----------------

Sapling provides a mechanism to allow the efficient creation of
diversified payment addresses with the same spending authority. A group
of such addresses shares the same full viewing key and incoming viewing
key, and so creating as many unlinkable addresses as needed does not
increase the cost of scanning the block chain for relevant transactions.

The above key path levels include an account identifier, which in all
user interfaces is represented as a \"bucket of funds\" under the
control of a single spending authority. Therefore, wallets implementing
Sapling ZIP 32 derivation MUST support the following path for any
account in range {0..2^31^-1}:

    m_Sapling / purpose' / coin_type' / account'

Furthermore, wallets MUST support generating the default payment address
(corresponding to the default diversifier as defined above) for any
account they support. They MAY also support generating a stream of
payment addresses for a given account, if they wish to maintain the user
experience of giving a unique address to each recipient.

Note that a given account can have a maximum of approximately 2^87^
payment addresses, because each diversifier has around a 50% chance of
being invalid.

If in certain circumstances a wallet needs to derive independent spend
authorities within a single account, they MAY additionally support a
non-hardened `address_index` path level as in[^22]:

    m_Sapling / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / address_index

Sprout key path
---------------

Wallets implementing Sprout ZIP 32 derivation MUST support the following
path:

    m_Sprout / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / address_index

Specification: Fingerprints and Tags
====================================

Sapling Full Viewing Key Fingerprints and Tags
----------------------------------------------

A \"Sapling full viewing key fingerprint\" of a full viewing key with
raw encoding *FVK* (as specified in[^23] section 5.6.7) is given by:

> BLAKE2b-256(\"ZcashSaplingFVFP\", *FVK*)

It MAY be used to uniquely identify a particular Sapling full viewing
key.

A \"Sapling full viewing key tag\" is the first 4 bytes of the
corresponding Sapling full viewing key fingerprint. It is intended for
optimizing performance of key lookups, and MUST NOT be assumed to
uniquely identify a particular key.

Sprout Address Fingerprints and Tags
------------------------------------

A \"Sprout address fingerprint\" of a Sprout payment address with raw
encoding *ADDR* (as specified in [^24] section 5.6.3, including the lead
bytes) is given by:

> BLAKE2b-256(\"Zcash\_Sprout\_AFP\", *ADDR*)

It MAY be used to uniquely identify a particular Sprout payment address.

A \"Sprout address tag\" is the first 4 bytes of the corresponding
Sprout address fingerprint. It is intended for optimizing performance of
address lookups, and MUST NOT be assumed to uniquely identify a
particular address.

Seed Fingerprints
-----------------

A \"seed fingerprint\" for the master seed *S* of a hierarchical
deterministic wallet is given by:

> BLAKE2b-256(\"Zcash\_HD\_Seed\_FP\", *S*)

It MAY be used to uniquely identify a particular hierarchical
deterministic wallet.

No corresponding short tag is defined.

Specification: Key Encodings
============================

The following encodings are analogous to the `xprv` and `xpub` encodings
defined in BIP 32 for transparent keys and addresses. Each key type has
a raw representation and a Bech32[^25] encoding.

Sapling extended spending keys
------------------------------

A Sapling extended spending key (*ask*, *nsk*, *ovk*, *dk*, *c*), at
depth *depth*, with parent full viewing key tag *parent\_fvk\_tag* and
child number *i*, is represented as a byte sequence:

> I2LEOSP~8~(*depth*) \|\| *parent\_fvk\_tag* \|\| I2LEOSP~32~(*i*) \|\|
> *c* \|\| EncodeExtSKParts(*ask*, *nsk*, *ovk*, *dk*)

For the master extended spending key, *depth* is 0, *parent\_fvk\_tag*
is 4 zero bytes, and *i* is 0.

When encoded as Bech32, the Human-Readable Part is
`secret-extended-key-main` for the production network, or
`secret-extended-key-test` for the test network.

Sapling extended full viewing keys
----------------------------------

A Sapling extended full viewing key (*ak*, *nk*, *ovk*, *dk*, *c*), at
depth *depth*, with parent full viewing key tag *parent\_fvk\_tag* and
child number *i*, is represented as a byte sequence:

> I2LEOSP~8~(*depth*) \|\| *parent\_fvk\_tag* \|\| I2LEOSP~32~(*i*) \|\|
> *c* \|\| EncodeExtFVKParts(*ak*, *nk*, *ovk*, *dk*)

For the master extended full viewing key, *depth* is 0,
*parent\_fvk\_tag* is 4 zero bytes, and *i* is 0.

When encoded as Bech32, the Human-Readable Part is `zxviews` for the
production network, or `zxviewtestsapling` for the test network.

Sprout extended spending keys
-----------------------------

A Sprout extended spending key (*a*~sk~, *c*), at depth *depth*, with
parent address tag *parent\_addr\_tag* and child number *i*, is
represented as a byte sequence:

> I2LEOSP~8~(*depth*) \|\| *parent\_addr\_tag* \|\| I2LEOSP~32~(*i*)
> \|\| *c* \|\| EncodeASK(*a*~sk~)

For the master extended spending key, *depth* is 0, *parent\_addr\_tag*
is 4 zero bytes, and *i* is 0.

When encoded as Bech32, the Human-Readable Part is `zxsprout` for the
production network, or `zxtestsprout` for the test network. Sprout
extended spending keys are encoded using Bech32 even though other Sprout
keys and addresses are encoded using Base58Check.

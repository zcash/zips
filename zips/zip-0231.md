Specification. [^protocol]

The terms "Mainnet" and "Testnet" are to be interpreted as described in
§ 3.12 ‘Mainnet and Testnet’. [^protocol-networks]


# Abstract

Currently, the memo sent in a shielded output is limited to at most 512 bytes.
This ZIP proposes to allow larger memos, and to enable memo data to be shared
between multiple recipients of a transaction.


# Motivation

In Zcash transaction versions v2 to v5 inclusive, each Sapling or Orchard
shielded output contains a ciphertext comprised of a 52-byte note plaintext,
and a corresponding 512-byte memo field. [^protocol-noteptconcept] Recipients
can only decrypt the outputs sent to them, and thus can also only observe the
memo fields included with the outputs they can decrypt.

The shielded transaction protocol hides the sender(s) (that is, the addresses
corresponding to the keys used to spend the input notes) from all of the
recipients. For certain kinds of transactions, it is desirable to make one or
more sender addresses available to one or more recipients (for example, a reply
address). In such circumstances it is important to authenticate the sender
addresses, to give the recipient a guarantee that the address is controlled by
a sender of the transaction; failure to authenticate this address can enable
phishing attacks. These Authenticated Reply Addresses require zero-knowledge
proofs, and for the Orchard protocol these proofs are too large to fit into a
512-byte memo field.

It is also desirable, for clients with more stringent bandwidth constraints,
to be able to transmit encrypted notes to the client without including the
encrypted memo data. In the current light client protocol [^zip-0307], this
is done by truncating the note ciphertext to just the part that encrypts the
memo. However, that has the effect of truncating the authentication tag, and
so the resulting decryption algorithm does not meet standard security notions
for an authenticated encryption scheme. It is a goal of this proposal to
rectify this, simplifying the security argument.

Instead of the memo data, this ZIP proposes that it is possible to indicate whether
a memo is present for the recipient. When using the light client protocol, a recipient
need not download full transaction information if this indication tells them that they
have not received any memo in the transaction.

At present, it is not possible to transmit the same memo data to multiple 
transaction recipients without redundantly encoding that data, and sending
memo data greater than 512 bytes requires sending multiple outputs; the
problem is compounded when attempting to send more than 512 bytes to each
recipient. By separating memo data from the decryption capability for those
memos, it admits a greater variety of applications that utilize memo data,
while decreasing the amount of data that needs to be stored on-chain overall.


# Privacy Implications

Prior to the activation of this ZIP, every shielded output has an associated
memo field. A chain observer can therefore infer a likely 1:1 correlation
between transaction recipients and memo payloads. The maximum number of
distinct memos is precisely known, and the bounds on possible memo sizes are
very small (between 0 and 512 bytes). It is possible to send additional data to
a single recipient by adding (potentially zero-valued) outputs; on-chain this is
indistinguishable from sending more memos to more recipients or (in the case of
Orchard) spending more input notes.

After the activation of this ZIP, recipient count and memo count are decoupled.
It becomes possible to construct transactions for which there are many more
recipients than distinct memos, or vice versa. This may result in more observably
distinct patterns relating the number of recipients to the number of possible
memos. One important example is that if a wallet includes an authenticated
reply-to address, this may be distinguishable from other ordinary wallet
behaviour.

On the flip side, a chain observer now only knows upper bounds on the amount
of memo data being conveyed, and the number of possible distinct memos.
They have no information about how memo data is split among the recipients.
This can provide a privacy improvement in some situations. For example, it is
not possible to distinguish between many recipients receiving many small
memos, and the same set of recipients receiving one large shared memo.

In summary, when sending large amounts of memo data, the change introduced by
this ZIP eliminates a potential distinguisher along one axis in exchange for a
potential distinguisher along another.


# Requirements

- Recipients can receive memo data that is greater than 512 bytes in length.
- Multiple recipients, across any of the shielded pools, can be given the
  capability to view the same memo data.
- The exact number and exact lengths of distinct decryptable memos should not
  be revealed, even to the transaction recipients, although an upper bound on
  the total length of memo data that the observer does not have the capability
  to view will be leaked to transaction recipients, and the overall maximum
  possible length of memo data will be revealed on-chain.
- A recipient can determine whether or not they have been given the capability
  to view any memo solely by decrypting the note ciphertext.
- Memo chunks within a transaction can be individually pruned from block storage
  without preventing the transaction from being verified when transmitting block
  data to peers.
- The ciphertext of the note alone can be decrypted using a scheme that meets
  a standard security notion for authenticated encryption, without more than a
  small constant overhead in ciphertext size.


# Non-requirements

- Recipients do not need to be able to receive multiple memos per note. This
  capability can however be enabled under the existing proposal by "chaining" 
  memos, including the decryption key for another memo within the memo that 
  is decryptable by a recipient.


# Specification

Since this proposal is defined only for v6 and later transactions, it is not
necessary to consider Sprout JoinSplit outputs. The following sections apply
to both Sapling and Orchard outputs.

## Memo bundle

A memo bundle consists of a sequence of 256-byte memo chunks, each individually
encrypted. These memo chunks represent zero or more encrypted memos.

Each transaction may contain a single memo bundle, and a memo bundle may contain
at most $\mathsf{memo\_chunk\_limit}$ = 64 memo chunks. This limits the total amount
of memo data that can be conveyed within a single transaction to
$\mathsf{memo\_chunk\_limit}$ × 256 = 16384 bytes, or 16 KiB.

Memo bundles are encoded in transactions in a prunable manner: each memo chunk
can be replaced by its representative digest.

## Memo encryption

During transaction construction, each output with memo data is assigned a 32-byte
memo key $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$. These keys SHOULD be generated randomly, and MUST NOT
be used to encrypt more than one memo within a single transaction. If an output has
no memo data, it is assigned the memo key consisting of 32 $\mathtt{0xFF}$ bytes.

In note plaintexts of v6-onward transactions, the 512-byte memo field is replaced
by $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$.

The transaction builder generates a 32-byte salt value $\mathsf{salt}$ from a CSPRNG.
A new salt MUST be generated for each memo bundle.

The symmetric encryption key for a memo is derived from its $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$ as follows:

$\hspace{2em}\mathsf{encryption\_key} = \mathsf{PRF^{expand}_{K^{memo}}}([\mathtt{0xE0}] \,||\, \mathsf{salt})$

The first byte $\mathtt{0xE0}$ should be added to the documentation of inputs to
$\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}$ in § 4.1.2 ‘Pseudo Random Functions’ [^protocol-abstractprfs].

If the generated key is 32 $\mathtt{0xFF}$ bytes, the transaction constructor MAY
repeat this procedure with a different salt, in order to avoid the recipient
misinterpreting the output as having no memo data. Since that has negligible
probability, it alternatively MAY omit this check.

Each memo is padded to a multiple of 256 bytes with zeroes, and split into
256-byte chunks. Each memo chunk is encrypted with ChaCha20Poly1305 [^rfc-8439]
as follows:

$\hspace{2em}\mathsf{IETF\_AEAD\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305}(\mathsf{encryption\_key}, \mathsf{nonce}, \mathsf{memo\_chunk})$

where $\mathsf{nonce} = \mathsf{I2BEOSP}_{88}(\mathsf{counter}) \,||\, [\mathsf{is\_final\_chunk}]$.

This is a variant of the STREAM construction [^stream].

- $\mathsf{counter}$ is a big-endian chunk counter starting at zero and incrementing
  by one for each subsequent chunk within a particular memo.
- $\mathsf{is\_final\_chunk}$ is the byte $\mathtt{0x01}$ for the final memo chunk, and
  $\mathtt{0x00}$ for all preceding chunks.

Finally, the encrypted memo chunks for all memos are combined into a single
sequence using an order-preserving shuffle. Memo chunks from different memos MAY
be interleaved in any order, but memo chunks from the same memo MUST have the
same relative order. The following diagram shows an example shuffle of three
memos:

```
[
    (memo_a, 0),
    (memo_b, 0),
    (memo_a, 1),
    (memo_c, 0),
    (memo_c, 1),
    (memo_a, 2),
]
```
## Memo decryption

When a recipient decrypts a shielded output, they obtain a memo key $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$.
From this they derive `encryption_key` as above, and then proceed as follows:

$\hspace{1.5em}$ let mutable $\mathsf{memo} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathbb{N} \leftarrow 0 \\$
$\hspace{1.5em}$ let mutable $\mathsf{counter} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathbb{N} \leftarrow 0 \\$
$\hspace{1.5em}$ let mutable $\mathsf{potential\_last\_chunk\_index} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathbb{N} \leftarrow 0 \\$
$\hspace{1.5em}$ for $i$ from $0$ up to $\mathtt{nMemoChunks}-1$: $\\$
$\hspace{3.0em}$     if $\mathtt{vMemoChunks}[i]$ is not pruned: $\\$
$\hspace{4.5em}$         let $\mathsf{nonce} = \mathsf{I2BEOSP}_{88}(\mathsf{counter}) \,||\, [\mathtt{0x00}] \\$
$\hspace{4.5em}$         let $P = \mathsf{IETF\_AEAD\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305.Decrypt}(\mathsf{encryption\_key}, \mathsf{nonce}, \mathtt{vMemoChunks}[i]) \\$
$\hspace{4.5em}$         if $P \neq \bot$: $\\$
$\hspace{6.0em}$             set $\mathsf{memo} \leftarrow \mathsf{memo} \,||\, P \\$
$\hspace{6.0em}$             set $\mathsf{counter} \leftarrow \mathsf{counter} + 1 \\$
$\hspace{6.0em}$             set $\mathsf{potential\_last\_chunk\_index} \leftarrow i + 1 \\$
$\,\\$
$\hspace{1.5em}$ let $\mathsf{final\_nonce} = \mathsf{I2BEOSP}_{88}(\mathsf{counter}) \,||\, [\mathtt{0x01}] \\$
$\hspace{1.5em}$ let mutable $\mathsf{success} \leftarrow \kern0.05em$ false $\\$
$\hspace{1.5em}$ for $i$ from $0$ up to $\mathtt{nMemoChunks}-1$: $\\$
$\hspace{3.0em}$     if $\mathtt{vMemoChunks}[i]$ is not pruned: $\\$
$\hspace{4.5em}$         let $P = \mathsf{IETF\_AEAD\_CHACHA20\_POLY1305.Decrypt}(\mathsf{encryption\_key}, \mathsf{final\_nonce}, \mathtt{vMemoChunks}[i]) \\$
$\hspace{4.5em}$         if $i \geq \mathsf{potential\_last\_chunk\_index}$ and $P \neq \bot$ and not $\mathsf{success}$: $\\$
$\hspace{6.0em}$             set $\mathsf{memo} \leftarrow \mathsf{memo} \,||\, P \\$
$\hspace{6.0em}$             set $\mathsf{success} \leftarrow \kern0.05em$ true $\\$
$\,\\$
$\hspace{1.5em}$ if $\mathsf{success}$ then return $\mathsf{memo}$ else return $\bot \\$

If any chunk of the memo encrypted to $\mathsf{encryption\_key}$ has been pruned, the decryption
process above returns nothing (as $\mathsf{final\_nonce}$ will be set to the wrong counter value
followed by $\mathtt{0x01}$), ensuring that a malformed memo is not returned.

|   32     | $\mathtt{nonceOrHash}$ | $\mathtt{byte}[32]$                                       | The nonce for deriving encryption keys, or the overall hash.          |
| † varies | $\mathtt{nMemoChunks}$ | $\mathtt{compactSize}$                                    | The number of memo chunks.                                            |

† These fields are present if and only if $\mathtt{fAllPruned} = 0$.

If $\mathtt{fAllPruned} = 0$, then:

- $\mathtt{nonceOrHash}$ represents the nonce for deriving encryption keys.
- Each bit of $\mathtt{pruned}$, in little-endian order, indicates the type of the
  corresponding entry in $\mathtt{vMemoChunks}$. A bit value of 0 indicates that
  the entry will be of type $\mathtt{byte}[272]$ representing an encrypted memo
  chunk. A bit value of 1 indicates the entry will be a $\mathtt{byte}[32]$ and
  contains the $\mathsf{memo\_chunk\_digest}$ for a pruned chunk.

If $\mathtt{fAllPruned} = 1$, then:

- $\mathtt{nonceOrHash}$ represents the overall hash for the memo bundle as defined in
  [Transaction sighash].
- The $\mathtt{nMemoChunks}$, $\mathtt{pruned}$, and $\mathtt{vMemoChunks}$ fields will be absent.

## Transaction sighash

$\mathsf{memo\_chunk\_digest}[i] = H(\mathtt{vMemoChunks}[i]) \\$
$\mathsf{memo\_bundle\_digest} = H(\mathsf{concat}(\mathsf{memo\_chunk\_digests}))$

The memo bundle digest structure is a performance optimization for the case
where all memo chunks in a transaction have been pruned.

TODO: finish this to be a modification to the equivalent of ZIP 244 for
transaction v6.

## Changes to ZIP 317 [^zip-0317]

The conventional fee in ZEC is altered such that a memo bundle may contain two
free chunks if there are any shielded outputs in the transaction. Any memo chunk
beyond this requires `marginal_fee`. See the Fee calculation section of ZIP 317
[^zip-0317-fee-calculation] for details.

## Network protocol

Nodes must reject `GetData` responses having an $\mathtt{fAllPruned}$ value that is nonzero,
or any byte of $\mathtt{pruned}$ that is nonzero.

## Changes to the Zcash Protocol Specification

The following changes affecting the definitions of note plaintexts and note ciphertexts,
and the algorithms for encryption and decryption.

In § 3.2.1 ‘Note Plaintexts and Memo Fields’:

In § 5.5 ‘Encodings of Note Plaintexts and Memo Fields’ [^protocol-noteptencoding]:

* Change the paragraph that describes "The encoding of a Sapling or Orchard note plaintext"
  to refer to "The encoding of a pre-v6 Sapling or Orchard note plaintext".

* Add a new paragraph at the end of the section:

    > The encoding of a v6-onward Sapling or Orchard note plaintext consists of:
    >
    > $\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \raisebox{0.6ex}{\mathstrut} \text{8-bit } \mathsf{leadByte} & \text{88-bit } \mathsf{d} & \text{64-bit } \mathsf{v} & \text{256-bit } \mathsf{rseed} & \text{32-byte } \mathsf{K^{memo}} \\\hline \end{array}$

    >
    > A value consisting of 32 $\mathtt{0xFF}$ bytes for $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$ is used
    > to indicate that there is no memo for this note plaintext.

In § 4.7.2 ‘Sending Notes (Sapling)’ [^protocol-saplingsend] and
§ 4.7.3 ‘Sending Notes (Orchard)’ [^protocol-orchardsend]:

* Add a reference to this ZIP specifying the construction of the memo bundle and
  derivation of $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$ in the case of a v6-onward note plaintext.

* Change

    > Let $\mathbf{np} = (\mathsf{leadByte}, \mathsf{d}, \mathsf{v}, \mathsf{rseed}, \mathsf{memo})$.

    to

    > Let $\mathbf{np}$ be the encoding of a Sapling note plaintext using $\mathsf{leadByte}$, $\mathsf{d}$,
    > $\mathsf{v}$, $\mathsf{rseed}$, and either $\mathsf{memo}$ for a pre-v6 note plaintext or
    > $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$ for a v6-onward note plaintext.

    replacing "Sapling" with Orchard in the case of § 4.7.3.

In § 4.20.1 ‘Encryption (Sapling and Orchard)’ [^protocol-saplingandorchardinband]:

* Change

    > Let $\mathbf{np} = (\mathsf{leadByte}, \mathsf{d}, \mathsf{v}, \mathsf{rseed}, \mathsf{memo})$
    > be the Sapling or Orchard note plaintext. $\mathbf{np}$ is encoded as defined
    > in § 5.5 ‘Encodings of Note Plaintexts and Memo Fields’.

    to

    > Let $\mathbf{np}$ be the encoding of the Sapling or Orchard note plaintext (which may be
    > pre-v6 or v6-onward), as defined in § 5.5 ‘Encodings of Note Plaintexts and Memo Fields’.

* Add another normative note to that section:

    > * $\mathsf{C^{enc}}$ will be of length either 580 or 100 bytes, depending on whether
    >   $\mathbf{np}$ is a pre-v6 or v6-onward note plaintext.

In § 4.20.2 ‘Decryption using an Incoming Viewing Key (Sapling and Orchard)’ [^protocol-decryptivk]
and § 4.20.3 ‘Decryption using a Full Viewing Key (Sapling and Orchard)’ [^protocol-decryptovk]:

* Replace $\mathsf{memo} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathbb{B}^{{\kern-0.05em\tiny\mathbb{Y}}[512]}$ with
  $\mathsf{memoOrKey}$.
* Specify that the type of $\mathsf{memoOrKey}$ is $\mathbb{B}^{{\kern-0.05em\tiny\mathbb{Y}}[512]}$
  when decrypting a pre-v6 note ciphertext, or $\mathbb{B}^{{\kern-0.05em\tiny\mathbb{Y}}[32]}$ when
  decrypting a v6-onward note ciphertext. In the latter case, it is used as $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$
  to decrypt the memo bundle as described in [Memo bundle].

## Applicability

All of these changes apply identically to Mainnet and Testnet.


# Open issues

## Interaction with ZIP 302 [^zip-0302]

TBD


# Rationale

## Memo bundle size restriction

Restricting the total amount of memo data in a bundle, for example to 16 KiB,
limits the rate at which the chain size can grow cheaply (from a computational
perspective; memo bundles are much easier to produce than proofs or signatures).

The current behaviour for previous transaction versions (no limit on the number
of memos) is not altered by this ZIP, because memos in those transactions are
tied to individual shielded outputs (incurring their computational cost), and
are not natively aggregatable.

## Memo chunk size

To understand the effect of memo chunk size, we construct a table showing the
total amount of data stored on-chain when encoding 16 KiB of memo data to as
many recipients as possible.

Each table entry has the format "$N$ @ $M$ ($O$)" where $N$ is the maximum
number of distinct recipients you can have within the memo data limits, $M$
is the cost in bytes of that memo data plus memo keys and authentication tags
when using a 32-byte memo key, and $O$ is the relative overhead compared to
pre-ZIP-231 memos.

<details>
<summary>
Calculation details
</summary>

Let:
- $D$ be the limit on total memo data (16384 bytes);
- $C$ be the chunk size (256 or 512 bytes);
- $S$ be the maximum length of an individual memo (256 or 512 bytes);
- $K$ be the key size (32 bytes);
- $A$ be the authentication tag size (16 bytes);
- $L$ be the limit on the number of chunks (32 or $\infty$).

Then
- $N = \mathsf{min}(L, \mathsf{ceiling}(D / \mathsf{max}(C, S))$;
- $M = N × (S+K+A)$; and
- $O = (M / D - 1) × 100\%$.
</details>
<br/>

| Chunk size | Memo size ≤ 256 bytes| Memo size = 512 bytes|
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|  Pre-231   | 32 @ 16384 (  0.00%) | 32 @ 16384 (  0.00%) |
|    512     | 32 @ 17920 (+ 9.38%) | 32 @ 17920 (+ 9.38%) |
|    256     | 64 @ 19456 (+18.75%) | 32 @ 18432 (+12.50%) |
| 256 32-out | 32 @  9728 (-40.63%) |                      |

In the "256 32-out" case you have a distinguisher compared to old transactions,
in that you can tell the transaction is sending at most 256 bytes per recipient
rather than 512 if it is sending the maximum number of memos. But that's inherently
baked into the decision to use a smaller memo chunk size (and it is still
possible for the chunks to all be a single memo sent to all outputs, or anything
in between).

## Memo key size

16-byte (128-bit) keys don't meet Zcash's target security level of 125 bits,
as argued in [^protocol-inbandrationale].

However, for the sake of argument, if we used a 16-byte memo key instead of
32 bytes, the transaction size overhead would become:

| Chunk size | Memo size ≤ 256 bytes| Memo size = 512 bytes|
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|  Pre-231   | 32 @ 16384 (  0.00%) | 32 @ 16384 (  0.00%) |
|    512     | 32 @ 17408 (+ 6.25%) | 32 @ 17408 (+ 6.25%) |
|    256     | 64 @ 18432 (+12.50%) | 32 @ 17920 (+ 9.38%) |
| 256 32-out | 32 @  9216 (-43.75%) |                      |

The decrease in overhead is relatively modest in most cases, but more noticeable
for small memos with a 256-byte memo chunk.

The benefits of 256-bit keys are:

- They incur only a small transaction size overhead above the minimum key size
  that _would_ meet the target security level.
- This key length matches what we already use elsewhere for symmetric keys.

## Encryption format

Including a per-transaction $\mathsf{salt}$ in the derivation of
$\mathsf{encryption_key}$ gives protection against accidental (or intentional)
reuse of $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$ reuse across multiple transactions. We do not
protect against $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$ reuse within a transaction; it is up to
the transaction builder to ensure that the same $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$ is not
used to encrypt two different memos (and if they did so, normal clients would
either never observe the second memo, or would decrypt parts of each memo and
get a nonsensical and potentially insecure "spliced" memo).

We do not include commitments to the shielded outputs in the derivation of
$\mathsf{encryption\_key}$ for two reasons:

- It would force the transaction builder to fully define all shielded outputs
  before encrypting the memos, which might prevent potential use cases of PCZTs [^pczt].
- We don't want to unnecessarily prevent the ability to create a transaction
  with a memo bundle and no shielded outputs, as there may be use cases for,
  e.g. a fully-transparent transaction with encrypted memo, or a ZSA issuance
  transaction with exposed memo data using a well-known $\mathsf{K^{memo}}$.

## Pruned encoding

The separation of memo data from note data, and the new ability to easily store
variable-length memo data, opens up an attack vector against node operators for
storing arbitrary data. The transaction digest commitments to the memo bundle
are structured such that if a node operator is presented with a memo key (i.e.
they are given the capability to decrypt a particular memo), they can identify
and prune the corresponding memo chunks, while still enabling the transaction to
be validated as part of its corresponding block and broadcast over the network.

The transaction encoding permits pruning at the individual chunk level in order
to facilitate pruning an individual memo from a transaction without affecting the
other memos. This enables node operators to be responsive to, for example, GDPR
deletion requests.

Note that broadcasting a partially-pruned transaction means that the pruned
chunks no longer contribute to the upper bound on memo data.

The prunable structure does not introduce a censorship axis; memo bundles do not
reveal which memo chunks correspond to which memos, and therefore a network
adversary cannot selectively censor individual memos. They can censor any/all
chunks within specific transactions, however shielded transactions do not reveal
their senders, recipients, or amounts, and thus also cannot be individually
targeted for censorship.

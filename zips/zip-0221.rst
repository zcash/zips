Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted
as described in BCP 14 [#BCP14]_ when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

The terms "consensus branch", "epoch", and "network upgrade" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in ZIP 200. [#zip-0200]_

*Light client*
  A client that is not a full participant in the network of Zcash peers. It can send and
  receive payments, but does not store or validate a copy of the block chain.

*High probability*
  An event occurs with high probability if it occurs with probability $1-O(1/2^\lambda)$,
  where $\lambda$ is a security parameter.

*Negligible probability*
  An event occurs with negligible probability if it occurs with probability $O(1/2^\lambda)$,
  where $\lambda$ is the security parameter.

*Merkle mountain range (MMR)*
  A Merkle mountain range (MMR) is a binary hash tree that allows for efficient appends of
  new leaves without changing the value of existing nodes.


Abstract
========

This ZIP specifies modifications to the Zcash block header semantics and consensus rules
in order to support the probabilistic verification FlyClient protocol [#FlyClient]_. The
``hashFinalSaplingRoot`` commitment in the block header is replaced with a commitment to
the root of a Merkle Mountain Range (MMR), that in turn commits to various features of the
chain's history, including the Sapling commitment tree.


Background
==========

An MMR is a Merkle tree which allows for efficient appends, proofs, and verifications.
Informally, appending data to an MMR consists of creating a new leaf and then iteratively
merging neighboring subtrees with the same size. This takes at most $\log(n)$ operations
and only requires knowledge of the previous subtree roots, of which there are fewer than
$\log(n)$.

(example adapted from [#mimblewimble]_)
To illustrate this, consider a list of 11 leaves. We first construct the biggest perfect
binary subtrees possible by joining any balanced sibling trees that are the same size. We
do this starting from the left to the right, adding a parent as soon as 2 children exist.
This leaves us with three subtrees ("mountains") of altitudes 3, 1, and 0:

.. code-block:: text

       /\
      /  \
     /\  /\
    /\/\/\/\ /\ /

Note that the first leftmost peak is always the highest. We can number this structure in
the order by which nodes would be created, if the leaves were inserted from left to right:

.. code-block:: text

    Altitude

        3              14
                     /    \
                    /      \
                   /        \
                  /          \
        2        6            13
               /   \        /    \
        1     2     5      9     12     17
             / \   / \    / \   /  \   /  \   /
        0   0   1 3   4  7   8 10  11 15  16 18

and represent this numbering in a flat list:

  +----------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  | Position |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |
  +----------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
  | Altitude |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |
  +----------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Let $h$ be the altitude of a given node. We can easily jump to the node's right
sibling (if it has one) by adding $2^{h+1} - 1$ to its position, and its left child
(if it has one) by subtracting $2^h$. This allows us to efficiently find the subtree
roots ("peaks") of the mountains.

Once we have the positions of the mountain peaks, we "bag" them using the following
algorithm:

1. Generate a node connecting the 2 left-most peaks, forming a new peak.
2. Repeat 1. until we have a single peak.

Note that the extra nodes generated during the bagging process do not follow the above
rules for jumping between nodes.

                    /      \       \   \
                   /        \       \   \
                  /          \       \   \

               /   \       /    \      \   \

        0   0   1 3   4  7   8 10  11 15  16 18

MMR trees allow for efficient incremental set update operations (push, pop, prune). In
addition, MMR update operations and Merkle proofs for recent additions to the leaf set are
more efficient than other incremental Merkle tree implementations (e.g. Bitcoin's padded
leafset, sparse Merkle trees, and Zcash's incremental note commitment trees).


Motivation
==========

MMR proofs are used in the FlyClient protocol [#FlyClient]_, to reduce the proof size
needed for light clients to verify:

- the validity of a block chain received from a full node, and
- the inclusion of a block $B$ in that chain, and
- certain metadata of any block or range of blocks in that chain.

The protocol requires that an MMR that commits to the inclusion of all blocks since the
preceding network upgrade $(B_x, \ldots, B_{n-1})$ is formed for each block $B_n$.
The root $M_n$ of the MMR MUST be included in the header of $B_n$.

($\!x$ is the activation height of the preceding network upgrade.)

FlyClient reduces the number of block headers needed for light client verification of a
valid chain, from linear (as in the current reference protocol) to logarithmic in
block chain length. This verification is correct with high probability. It also allows
creation of subtree proofs, so light clients need only check blocks later than the most
recently verified block index. Following that, verification of a transaction inclusion
within that block follows the usual reference protocol [#zip-0307]_.

A smaller proof size could enable the verification of Zcash SPV Proofs in block-chain
protocols such as Ethereum, enabling efficient cross-chain communication and pegs. It also
reduces bandwidth and storage requirements for resource-limited clients like mobile or IoT
devices.


Specification
=============

For a block $B_n$ at height $n > 0$ in a given block chain, define the
"preceding network upgrade height" $x$ of $B_n$ to be the last network
upgrade activation height in the chain that is less than $n$. (For this definition,
block height $0$ is considered to be the height of a network upgrade activation.
The preceding network upgrade height of the genesis block is undefined.)

The leaves of the MMR at block $B_n$ are hash commitments to the header data
and metadata of each previous block $B_x, \ldots, B_{n-1}$, where $x$
is defined as above. We extend the standard MMR to allow metadata to propagate
upwards through the tree by either summing the metadata of both children, or inheriting
the metadata of a specific child as necessary. This allows us to create efficient proofs
of selected properties of a range of blocks without transmitting the entire range of
blocks or headers.

Tree Node specification
-----------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all hashes use BLAKE2b-256 with the personalization field set
to ``'ZcashHistory' || CONSENSUS_BRANCH_ID``. ``CONSENSUS_BRANCH_ID`` is the 4-byte
little-endian encoding of the consensus branch ID for the epoch of the block containing
the commitment. [#zip-0200]_ Which is to say, each node in the tree commits to the
consensus branch that produced it.

Each MMR node is defined as follows:

1. ``hashSubtreeCommitment``

   Leaf node
     The consensus-defined block hash for the corresponding block.

     * This hash is encoded in internal byte order, and does NOT use the BLAKE2b-256
       personalization string described above.
     * For clarity, in a given consensus branch, the ``hashSubtreeCommitment`` field
       of leaf $n-1$ is *precisely equal* to the ``hashPrevBlock`` field in the
       header of the block at height $x+n$, where $x$ is the network
       upgrade activation height of that consensus branch.

   Internal or root node
     * Both child nodes are serialized.
     * ``hashSubtreeCommitment`` is the BLAKE2b-256 hash of ``left_child || right_child``.
     * For clarity, this digest uses the BLAKE2b-256 personalization string described above.

   Serialized as ``char[32]``.

2. ``nEarliestTimestamp``

   Leaf node
     The header's timestamp.

   Internal or root node
     Inherited from the left child.

   Serialized as ``nTime`` (``uint32``).

   Note that a ``uint32`` time value would overflow on 2106-02-07, but this field (and
   ``nLatestTimestamp`` below) can only hold values that occur in the ``nTime`` field of
   a block header, which is also of type ``uint32``.

3. ``nLatestTimestamp``

   Leaf node
     The header's timestamp.

   Internal or root node
     Inherited from the right child.

   Note that due to timestamp consensus rules, ``nLatestTimestamp`` may be smaller than
   ``nEarliestTimestamp`` in some subtrees. This may occur within subtrees smaller than
   ``PoWMedianBlockSpan`` blocks.

   Serialized as ``nTime`` (``uint32``).

4. ``nEarliestTargetBits``

   Leaf node
     The header's ``nBits`` field.

   Internal or root node
     Inherited from the left child.

   Serialized as ``nBits`` (``uint32``).

5. ``nLatestTargetBits``

   Leaf node
     The header's ``nBits`` field.

   Internal or root node
     Inherited from the right child.

   Serialized as ``nBits`` (``uint32``).

6. ``hashEarliestSaplingRoot``

   Leaf node
     Calculated as ``hashFinalSaplingRoot``, as implemented in Sapling.

   Internal or root node
     Inherited from the left child.

   Serialized as ``char[32]``.

7. ``hashLatestSaplingRoot``

   Leaf node
     Calculated as ``hashFinalSaplingRoot``, as implemented in Sapling.

   Internal or root node
     Inherited from the right child.

   Serialized as ``char[32]``.

8. ``nSubTreeTotalWork``

   Leaf node
     The protocol-defined work of the block:
     $\mathsf{floor}(2^{256} / (\mathsf{ToTarget}(\mathsf{nBits}) + 1))$. [#protocol-workdef]_

   Internal or root node
     The sum of the ``nSubTreeTotalWork`` fields of both children.

     Computations modulo $2^{256}$ are fine here; cumulative chain work is similarly
     assumed elsewhere in the Zcash ecosystem to be at most $2^{256}$ (as inherited
     from Bitcoin). The computed work factors are, on average, equal to the computational
     efforts involved in the creation of the corresponding blocks, and an aggregate effort
     of $2^{256}$ or more is infeasible in practice.

   Serialized as ``uint256``.

9. ``nEarliestHeight``

   Leaf node
     The height of the block.

   Internal or root node
     Inherited from the left child.

   Serialized as ``CompactSize uint``.

10. ``nLatestHeight``

    Leaf node
      The height of the block.

    Internal or root node
      Inherited from the right child.

    Serialized as ``CompactSize uint``.

11. ``nSaplingTxCount``

    Leaf node
      The number of transactions in the leaf block where either of
      ``vSpendsSapling`` or ``vOutputsSapling`` is non-empty.

    Internal or root node
      The sum of the ``nSaplingTxCount`` field of both children.

    Serialized as ``CompactSize uint``.

12. [NU5 onward] ``hashEarliestOrchardRoot``

    Leaf node
      Calculated as the note commitment root of the final Orchard treestate
      (similar to ``hashEarliestSaplingRoot`` in Sapling).

    Internal or root node
      Inherited from the left child.

    Serialized as ``char[32]``.

13. [NU5 onward] ``hashLatestOrchardRoot``

    Leaf node
      Calculated as the note commitment root of the final Orchard treestate
      (similar to ``hashLatestSaplingRoot`` in Sapling).

    Internal or root node
      Inherited from the right child.

    Serialized as ``char[32]``.

14. [NU5 onward] ``nOrchardTxCount``

    Leaf node
      The number of transactions in the leaf block where ``vActionsOrchard``
      is non-empty.

    Internal or root node
      The sum of the ``nOrchardTxCount`` field of both children.

    Serialized as ``CompactSize uint``.


The fields marked "[NU5 onward]" are omitted before NU5 activation [#zip-0252]_.

Each node, when serialized, is between 147 and 171 bytes long (between 212 and 244 bytes
after NU5 activation). The canonical serialized representation of a node is used whenever
creating child commitments for future nodes. Other than the metadata commitments, the
MMR tree's construction is standard.

Once the MMR has been generated, we produce ``hashChainHistoryRoot``, which we define as
the BLAKE2b-256 digest of the serialization of the root node.

Incremental push and pop (pseudocode)
-------------------------------------

With each new block $B_n$, we append a new MMR leaf node corresponding to block
$B_{n-1}$. The ``append`` operation is detailed below in pseudocode (adapted from
[#FlyClient]_):

.. code-block:: python

    def get_peaks(node: ZcashMMRNode) -> List[ZcashMMRNode]:
        peaks: List[ZcashMMRNode] = []

        # Get number of leaves.
        leaves = latest_height - (earliest_height - 1)
        assert(leaves > 0)

        # Check if the number of leaves is a power of two.
        if (leaves & (leaves - 1)) == 0:
            # Tree is full, hence a single peak. This also covers the
            # case of a single isolated leaf.
            peaks.append(node)
        else:
            # If the number of leaves is not a power of two, then this
            # node must be internal, and cannot be a peak.
            peaks.extend(get_peaks(left_child))
            peaks.extend(get_peaks(right_child))

        return peaks


    def bag_peaks(peaks: List[ZcashMMRNode]) -> ZcashMMRNode:
        '''
        "Bag" a list of peaks, and return the final root
        '''
        root = peaks[0]
        for i in range(1, len(peaks)):
            root = make_parent(root, peaks[i])
        return root


    def append(root: ZcashMMRNode, leaf: ZcashMMRNode) -> ZcashMMRNode:
        '''Append a leaf to an existing tree, return the new tree root'''
        # recursively find a list of peaks in the current tree
        peaks: List[ZcashMMRNode] = get_peaks(root)
        merged: List[ZcashMMRNode] = []

        # Merge peaks from right to left. 
        # This will produce a list of peaks in reverse order
        current = leaf
        for peak in peaks[::-1]:
            current_leaves = current.latest_height - (current.earliest_height - 1)
            peak_leaves = peak.latest_height - (peak.earliest_height - 1)

            if current_leaves == peak_leaves:
                current = make_parent(peak, current)
            else:
                merged.append(current)
                current = peak
        merged.append(current)

        # finally, bag the merged peaks
        return bag_peaks(merged[::-1])

In case of a block reorg, we have to delete the latest (i.e. rightmost) MMR leaf nodes, up
to the reorg length. This operation is $O(\log(k))$ where $k$ is the number of leaves
in the right subtree of the MMR root.

.. code-block:: python

    def delete(root: ZcashMMRNode) -> ZcashMMRNode:
        '''
        Delete the rightmost leaf node from an existing MMR
        Return the new tree root
        '''

        n_leaves = root.latest_height - (root.earliest_height - 1)

            # until we reach a leaf
            subtree_root = root.right_child
            while subtree_root.left_child:
                peaks.push(subtree_root.left_child)
                subtree_root = subtree_root.right_child

        new_root = bag_peaks(peaks)
        return new_root

Block header semantics and consensus rules
------------------------------------------

The following specification is accurate before NU5 activation. See [#zip-0244]_ for header
field changes in NU5.

The ``hashFinalSaplingRoot`` block header field (which was named ``hashReserved`` prior to
the Sapling network upgrade) is renamed to ``hashLightClientRoot``, to reflect its usage
by light clients. (In NU5, this field is renamed again to ``hashBlockCommitments`` as specified
in [#zip-0244]_.)

Prior to activation of the network upgrade that deploys this ZIP, this existing consensus
rule on block headers (adjusted for the renamed field) is enforced: [#protocol-blockheader]_

    [Sapling onward] ``hashLightClientRoot`` MUST be $\mathsf{LEBS2OSP}_{256}(\mathsf{rt})$
    where $\mathsf{rt}$ is the root of the Sapling note commitment tree for the final
    Sapling tree state of this block.

In the block that activates this ZIP, ``hashLightClientRoot`` MUST be set to all zero bytes.
This MUST NOT be interpreted as a root hash.

In subsequent blocks, ``hashLightClientRoot`` MUST be set to the value of ``hashChainHistoryRoot``
as specified above.

The block header byte format and version are not altered by this ZIP.


Rationale
=========

Tree nodes
----------

Nodes in the commitment tree are canonical and immutable. They are cheap to generate, as
(with the exception of ``nSaplingTxCount`` and ``nOrchardTxCount``) all metadata is already
generated during block construction and/or checked during block validation. Nodes are
relatively compact in memory. As of the original publication of this ZIP, approximately
140,000 blocks had elapsed since Sapling activation. Assuming a 164-byte commitment to
each of these, we would have generated approximately 24 MB of additional storage cost for
the set of leaf nodes (and an additional ~24 MB for storage of intermediate nodes).

``hashSubtreeCommitment`` forms the structure of the commitment tree. Other metadata
commitments were chosen to serve specific purposes. Originally variable-length commitments
were placed last, so that most metadata in a node could be directly indexed. We considered
using fixed-length commitments here, but opted for variable-length, in order to marginally
reduce the memory requirements for managing and updating the commitment trees.

Orchard fields are placed last, in order to avoid complicating existing uses of the other
fields.

In leaf nodes, some information is repeated. We chose to do this so that leaf nodes could
be treated identically to internal and root nodes for all algorithms and (de)serializers.
Leaf nodes are easily identifiable, as they will show proof of work in the
``hashSubtreeCommitment`` field (which commits to the block hash for leaf nodes), and
their block range (calculated as ``nLatestHeight`` - (``nEarliestHeight`` - 1))
will be precisely 1.

Personalized BLAKE2b-256 was selected to match existing Zcash conventions. Adding the
consensus branch ID to the hash personalization string ensures that valid nodes from one
consensus branch cannot be used to make false statements about parallel consensus branches.

FlyClient Requirements and Recommendations
``````````````````````````````````````````
These commitments enable FlyClient in the variable-difficulty model. Specifically, they
allow light clients to reason about application of the difficulty adjustment algorithm
over a range of blocks. They were chosen via discussion with an author of the FlyClient
paper.

- ``nEarliestTimestamp``
- ``nLatestTimestamp``
- ``nEarliestTargetBits``
- ``nLatestTargetBits``
- ``nEarliestHeight``
- ``nLatestHeight``
- ``nSubTreeTotalWork``

Non-FlyClient Commitments
`````````````````````````
Additional metadata commitments were chosen primarily to improve light client security
guarantees. We specified commitments where we could see an obvious security benefit, but
there may be other useful metadata that we missed. We're interested in feedback and
suggestions from the implementers of the current light client.

We considered adding a commitment to the nullifier vector at each block. We would
appreciate comments from light client teams on the utility of this commitment, as well as
the proper serialization and commitment format for the nullifier vector, for possible
inclusion in a future upgrade.

- ``hashEarliestSaplingRoot``

  * Committing to the earliest Sapling root of a range of blocks allows light clients to
    check the consistency of treestate transitions over a range of blocks, without
    recalculating the root from genesis.

- ``hashLatestSaplingRoot``

  * This commitment serves the same purpose as ``hashFinalSaplingRoot`` in current Sapling
    semantics.
  * However, because the MMR tree commits to blocks $B_x \ldots B_{n-1}$, the latest
    commitment will describe the final treestate of the previous block, rather than the
    current block.
  * Concretely: block 500 currently commits to the final treestate of block 500 in its
    header. With this ZIP, block 500 will commit to all roots up to block 499, but not the
    final root of block 500.
  * We feel this is an acceptable tradeoff. Using the most recent treestate as a
    transaction anchor is already unsafe in reorgs. Clients should never use the most
    recent treestate to generate transactions, so it is acceptable to delay commitment by
    one block.

- ``nSaplingTxCount``

  * By committing to the number of Sapling transactions in blocks (and ranges of blocks),
    a light client may reliably learn whether a malicious server is witholding any
    Sapling transactions.
  * In addition, this commitment allows light clients to avoid syncing header ranges that
    do not contain Sapling transactions. As the primary cost of a light client is
    transmission of Equihash solution information in block headers, this optimization
    would significantly decrease the bandwidth requirements of light clients.
  * An earlier draft of this ZIP committed to the number of shielded transactions,
    counting both Sprout and Sapling. This commitment would not have been useful to light
    clients that only support Sapling addresses; they would not be able to distinguish
    between Sapling transactions being maliciously withheld, and Sprout transactions not
    being requested.
  * A commitment to the number of Sprout transactions in blocks was not included, because
    Sprout addresses are effectively deprecated at this point, and will not be supported
    by any light clients.
  * If a future network upgrade introduced a new shielded pool, a new commitment to that
    pool's transactions would be added, to similarly enable future light clients that do
    not support Sapling addresses.

- ``hashEarliestOrchardRoot``, ``hashLatestOrchardRoot``, and ``nOrchardTxCount``

  * These are included with the same rationale as for Sapling.


Header Format Change
--------------------

The primary goal of the original authors was to minimize header changes; in particular,
they preferred not to introduce changes that could affect mining hardware or embedded
software. Altering the block header format would require changes throughout the ecosystem,
so we decided against adding ``hashChainHistoryRoot`` to the header as a new field.

ZIP 301 states that "[Miner client software] SHOULD alert the user upon receiving jobs
containing block header versions they do not know about or support, and MUST ignore such
jobs." [#zip-0301]_ As the only formally defined block header version is 4, any header
version change requires changes to miner client software in order for miners to handle new
jobs from mining pools. We therefore do not alter the block version for this semantic
change. This does not make block headers ambiguous to interpret, because blocks commit to
their block height inside their coinbase transaction, [#bip-0034]_ and they are never
handled in a standalone context (unlike transactions, which exist in the mempool outside
of blocks).

Replacing ``hashFinalSaplingRoot`` with ``hashChainHistoryRoot`` does introduce the
theoretical possibility of an attack where a miner constructs a Sapling commitment tree
update that results in the same 32-byte value as the MMR root. We don't consider this a
realistic attack, both because the adversary would need to find a preimage over 32 layers
of Pedersen hash, and because light clients already need to update their code to include
the consensus branch ID for the Heartwood network upgrade, and can simultaneously make
changes to not rely on the value of this header field being the Sapling tree root.

We also considered putting ``hashChainHistoryRoot`` in the ``hashPrevBlock`` field as it
commits to the entire chain history, but quickly realized it would require massive
refactoring of the existing code base and would negatively impact performance. Reorgs in
particular are fragile, performance-critical, and rely on backwards iteration over the
chain history. If a chain were to be designed from scratch there may be some efficient
implementation that would join these commitments, but it is clearly not appropriate for
Zcash as it exists.

The calculation of ``hashChainHistoryRoot`` is not well-defined for the genesis block,
since then $n = 0$ and there is no block $B_{n-1}$. Also, in the case of
chains that activate this ZIP after genesis (including Zcash Mainnet and Testnet), the
``hashChainHistoryRoot`` of the activation block would commit to the whole previous epoch
if a special case were not made. It would be impractical to calculate this commitment all
at once, and so we specify that ``hashLightClientRoot`` is set to all zero bytes for that
block instead. The hash of the final Sapling note commitment tree root for the activation
block will not be encoded in that block, but will be committed to one block later in the
``hashLatestSaplingRoot`` field of the MMR root commitment.


Security and Privacy Considerations
===================================

This ZIP imposes an additional validation cost on new blocks. While this validation cost
is small, it may exacerbate any existing DoS opportunities, particularly during abnormal
events like long reorgs. Fortunately, these costs are logarithmic in the number of delete
and append operations. In the worst case scenario, a well-resourced attacker could
maintain 2 chains of approximately equal length, and alternate which chain they extend.
This would result in repeated reorgs of increasing length.

Given the performance of BLAKE2b, we expect this validation cost to be negligible.
However, it seems prudent to benchmark potential MMR implementations during the
implementation process. Should the validation cost be higher than expected, there are
several potential mitigations, e.g. holding recently seen nodes in memory after a reorg.

Generally, header commitments have no impact on privacy. However, FlyClient has additional
security and privacy implications. Because FlyClient is a motivating factor for this ZIP,
it seems prudent to include a brief overview. A more in-depth security analysis of
FlyClient should be performed before designing a FlyClient-based light client ecosystem
for Zcash.

FlyClient, like all light clients, requires a connection to a light client server. That
server may collect information about client requests, and may use that information to
attempt to deanonymize clients. However, because FlyClient proofs are non-interactive and
publicly verifiable, they could be shared among many light clients after the initial
server interaction.

FlyClient proofs are probabilistic. When properly constructed, there is negligible
probability that a dishonest chain commitment will be accepted by the verifier. The
security analysis assumes adversary mining power is bounded by a known fraction of
combined mining power of honest nodes, and cannot drop or tamper with messages between
client and full nodes. It also assumes the client is connected to at least one full node
and knows the genesis block.

In addition, [#FlyClient]_ only analyses these security properties in chain models with
slowly adjusting difficulty, such as Bitcoin. That paper leaves their analysis in chains
with rapidly adjusting difficulty –such as Zcash or Ethereum– as an open problem, and
states that the FlyClient protocol provides only heuristic security guarantees in that
case. However, as mentioned in `FlyClient Requirements and Recommendations`_, additional
commitments allowing light clients to reason about application of the difficulty adjustment
algorithm were added in discussion with an author of the FlyClient paper. The use of these
fields has not been analysed in the academic security literature. It would be possible to
update them in a future network upgrade if further security analysis were to find any
deficiencies.


Deployment
==========

On the Zcash Mainnet and Testnet, this proposal will be deployed with the Heartwood
network upgrade. [#zip-0250]_

Additional fields are added on activation of the NU5 network upgrade [#zip-0252]_,
to support the new Orchard shielded protocol.

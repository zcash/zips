===========
Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST" and "MUST NOT" in this document are to be interpreted as described
in BCP 14 [#BCP14]_ when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

The terms "consensus branch", "epoch", and "network upgrade" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in ZIP 200. [#zip-0200]_

The term "field encoding" refers to the binary serialized form of a Zcash transaction
field, as specified in section 7.1 of the Zcash protocol specification
[#protocol-txnencoding]_.


========
Abstract
========

This ZIP defines the sighash algorithms associated with the v6 transaction
format.

This proposal also defines the new concept of "sighash algorithm versioning":
where previously each transaction version had a single associated sighash
algorithm, going forward it will be possible for signers to use any sighash
algorithm within the closed set specified for a given transaction version (and
made available in consensus via network upgrades).

==========
Motivation
==========

The motivation for sighash algorithm versioning is that we want to be able to
specify the V6 transaction format and signatures without knowing what the
signatures for atomic swaps in action bundles will need to commit to. This
allows for future signature hash algorithms to be specified for V6 transactions
that support signing parts of a transaction while leaving the remainder of the
transaction malleable, or that commit to additional state that nodes may start
tracking in a future upgrade and that is not part of an individual transaction
being signed.

Being able to remove support for sighash algorithm versions makes it possible
to respond effectively in the case that a bug is found in a previously deployed
sighash algorithm.

============
Requirements
============

- Continue to support existing functionality of the protocol (e.g. multisig and
  signing modes for transparent inputs).

- It should be possible to update this ZIP with additional sighash algorithm
  versions that might have divergent behavior with respect to previous
  versions, after previous versions have been deployed in network upgrades.

- It should be possible to disable support for sighash algorithm versions in
  network upgrades.

- At the time that one is making a signature, the set of valid sighash
  algorithm versions is known to consensus.

- Sighash version information is present alongside the signature. 

================
Non-requirements
================

- Sighash algorithm versioning as defined in this ZIP does not need to
  constrain how signature hashes are constructed for future transaction
  versions.

=============
Specification
=============

------------------
Sighash versioning
------------------

Rough summary:

- Sighash versions are numbered starting from 0 for each tx version.
- v0 is by convention the "commit to all effecting data" sighash algorithm. Other
  versions can commit to whatever makes sense for desired functionality within
  that tx version.
- Have a single byte encoded alongside the signature (not appended in the manner
  of transparent sighash types) that permits the signer to specify which sighash
  algorithm version they are using.
- Consensus rules choose the digest algorithm for each signer based on that
  byte.

----------
v0 Digests
----------

The v0 digests are based on the v5 transaction digest algorithm defined in
ZIP 244 [#zip-0244]_.

Each node written as ``snake_case`` in this tree is a BLAKE2b-256 hash of its
children, initialized with a personalization string specific to that branch
of the tree. Nodes that are not themselves digests are written in ``camelCase``.
In the specification below, nodes of the tree are presented in depth-first order.

same definition as in ZIP 244 [#zip-0244]_.

Signature Digest
================

The per-input transaction digest algorithm to generate the signature digest in ZIP 244 [#zip-0244-sigdigest]_ is modified so that a signature digest is produced for each transparent input, each Sapling input, each OrchardZSA Action, and additionally for each Issuance Action.
The modifications replace the ``orchard_digest`` in ZIP 244 with a new ``orchard_digest``, and add a new branch, ``issuance_digest``, for the Issuance Action information.

The overall structure of the hash is as follows. We omit the descriptions of the sections that do not change for the OrchardZSA protocol::

    signature_digest
    ├── header_digest
    ├── transparent_sig_digest
    ├── sapling_digest
    ├── orchard_digest
    ├── issuance_digest
    └── memo_digest

signature_digest

A BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values ::

   S.3: sapling_digest         (32-byte hash output)
   S.4: orchard_digest         (32-byte hash output)
   S.5: issuance_digest        (32-byte hash output)
   S.6: memo_digest            (32-byte hash output)

The personalization field remains the same as in ZIP 244 [#zip-0244]_, namely::

  "ZcashTxHash_" || CONSENSUS_BRANCH_ID

``ZcashTxHash_`` has 1 underscore character.

S.4: orchard_digest
```````````````````
Identical to that specified for the transaction identifier.

S.5: issuance_digest
````````````````````
Identical to the ``issuance_digest`` specified for the transaction identifier.

S.6: memo_digest
````````````````
Identical to that specified for the transaction identifier.


Authorizing Data Commitment
===========================

The transaction digest algorithm defined in ZIP 244 [#zip-0244-authcommitment]_ which commits to the authorizing data of a transaction is modified by the OrchardZSA protocol to have the structure specified in this section.
There is a new branch added for issuance information, and the ``orchard_auth_digest`` in ZIP 244 is replaced with ``orchard_auth_digest`` to account for the presence of Action Groups.

We omit the descriptions of the sections that do not change for the OrchardZSA protocol::

    auth_digest
    ├── transparent_scripts_digest
    ├── sapling_auth_digest
    ├── orchard_auth_digest
    └── issuance_auth_digest

The pair (Transaction Identifier, Auth Commitment) constitutes a commitment to all the data of a serialized transaction that may be included in a block.

   A.3: orchard_auth_digest        (32-byte hash output)
   A.4: issuance_auth_digest       (32-byte hash output)

The personalization field of this hash remains the same as in ZIP 244.


A.3: orchard_auth_digest
````````````````````````

In the case that OrchardZSA Action Groups are present, this is a BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values::

    A.3a: orchard_action_groups_auth_digest  (32-byte hash output)
    A.3b: bindingSigOrchard                      (field encoding bytes)

The personalization field of this hash is the same as in ZIP 244, that is::

    "ZTxAuthOrchaHash"

In case that the transaction has no OrchardZSA Action Groups, ``orchard_auth_digest`` is::

    BLAKE2b-256("ZTxAuthOrchaHash", [])

    A.3a.i:  proofsOrchard               (field encoding bytes)
    A.3a.ii: spendAuthSigsOrchard        (field encoding bytes)

   A.4a: issueAuthSig            (field encoding bytes)

The personalization field of this hash is set to::

  "ZTxAuthZSAOrHash"

In the case that the transaction has no Orchard Actions, ``issuance_auth_digest`` is ::

  BLAKE2b-256("ZTxAuthZSAOrHash", [])

The field encodings are specified in ZIP 230 [#zip-0230-transaction-field-encodings]_.

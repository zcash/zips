# Terminology

The key word "MUST" in this document is to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [^BCP14] when, and only when, it appears in all capitals.

The term "network upgrade" in this document is to be interpreted as described
in ZIP 200. [^zip-0200]

The character § is used when referring to sections of the Zcash Protocol
Specification. [^protocol]

The terms "Mainnet" and "Testnet" are to be interpreted as described in
§ 3.12 ‘Mainnet and Testnet’. [^protocol-networks]

"ZEC/TAZ" refers to the native currency of Zcash on a given network, i.e.
ZEC on Mainnet and TAZ on Testnet.

"Block Subsidy" - The algorithmic issuance of ZEC/TAZ on block creation, as
defined by consensus. This is split between the miner and Funding Streams.

"Issuance" - The method by which ZEC/TAZ becomes available for circulation
on the network. [TODO: there is a potential terminology conflict between
this and issuance as defined in ZIP 227.]

$\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY}$, as defined in § 5.3 ‘Constants’ [^protocol-constants],
is the total ZEC/TAZ supply cap measured in zatoshi, corresponding to
21,000,000 ZEC. This is slightly larger than the supply cap for the current
issuance mechanism, but is the value used in existing critical consensus
checks.


# Abstract

This ZIP proposes the introduction of a mechanism to voluntarily remove funds
entirely from circulation on the network. This mechanism, in combination with
ZIP 234 [^zip-0234] and ZIP 235 [^zip-0235], comprises a long-term strategy for
the sustainability of the network. We will refer to the combined effects of
these three ZIPs as the “Network Sustainability Mechanism”.


# Motivation

This mechanism seeks to address concerns about the sustainability of the network
design shared by Bitcoin-like systems:

1. **Long Term Consensus Sustainability:** By enabling the removal of funds from
   circulation, the network gains the ability to create "headroom" between the
   chain value and $\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY}$. This lays necessary groundwork for
   extending the block subsidy system, which currently has a clear final end
   date.
2. **Benefits to ZEC Holders:** Removing funds from circulation reduces the
   circulating supply of ZEC. To the extent that this potentially contributes to
   an increase in the value of remaining ZEC, it can be argued to benefit network
   users in proportion to their holdings — without requiring them to opt into any
   scheme, introducing extra risk, active oversight, or accounting complexity.


# Specification

## Transaction Field

Each transaction gains a $\mathsf{zip233\_amount}$ property, specifying the
value in zatoshis that is removed from circulation when the transaction is
mined. The value removed from circulation subtracts from the remaining value in
the "transparent transaction value pool" as described in § 3.4 ‘Transactions and
Treestates’ [^protocol-transactions].

$\mathsf{zip233\_amount}$ does not result in an output being produced in any
chain value pool, and therefore from the point at which the transaction is
applied to the global chain state, $\mathsf{zip233\_amount}$ is subtracted from
the issued supply. It is unavailable for circulation on the network at least
through to the end of the block in which the transaction is mined. ZIP 234
[^zip-0234] specifies a potential mechanism by which the funds removed from
circulation would again become available.

## Changes to ZIP 230 [^zip-0230]

The following field is appended to the Common Transaction Fields of the v6
transaction format after `nExpiryHeight` [^zip-0230-transaction-format]:

| Bytes | Name           | Data Type | Description                                                                |
|-------|----------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   8   | `zip233Amount` | `uint64`  | The value to be removed from circulation in this transaction, in zatoshis. |

The $\mathsf{zip233\_amount}$ of a transaction is defined to be the value of the
`zip233Amount` field if present, and otherwise 0.

Notes:

* If both this ZIP and ZIP 2002 are selected for inclusion in the same Network
  Upgrade, then the ambiguity in ordering of the fields added by these ZIPs
  would need to be resolved.
* Older transaction versions can continue to be supported after a network
  upgrade, but removing funds from circulation is not possible for these
  transactions. For example, NU5 supports both v4 and v5 transaction formats,
  for both coinbase and non-coinbase transactions.

## Changes to the Zcash Protocol Specification

Make a change to § 3.4 ‘Transactions and Treestates’ [^protocol-transactions]
implementing the specification in [ZIP-233 Amount].

In § 7.1 ‘Transaction Encoding and Consensus’ [^protocol-txnconsensus], add:

> [NU7 onward] $\mathsf{zip233\_amount}$ MUST be in the range $\{ 0 .. \mathsf{MAX\_MONEY} \}$.

## Modifications relative to ZIP 244 [^zip-0244]

Relative to the sighash algorithm defined in ZIP 244, the sighash algorithm
that applies to v6 transactions differs by appending the encoding of
$\mathsf{zip233\_amount}$ to the Common Transaction Fields that are the input
to the digest in T.1: `header_digest` [^zip-0244-t-1-header-digest]:

>     T.1f: zip233_amount (8-byte little-endian amount to remove from circulation)

Note: If both this ZIP and ZIP 2002 are selected for inclusion in the same
Network Upgrade, then the ambiguity in ordering of the fields added by these
ZIPs would need to be resolved.

## Applicability

All of these changes apply identically to Mainnet and Testnet.


# Rationale

All technical decisions in this ZIP are balanced between the necessary
robustness of the NSM mechanics, and simplicity of implementation.

## New transaction field for amount to remove from circulation

An explicit value distinguishes the funds to remove from circulation from
the transaction fee. Explicitness also ensures any arithmetic flaws in any
implementations are more likely to be observed and caught immediately.


# Deployment

This ZIP is proposed to activate with Network Upgrade 7. [^zip-0254]

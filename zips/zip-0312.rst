Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [#BCP14]_ when, and
only when, they appear in all capitals.

The term "Recovery Protocol" in this document is to be interpreted as described
in [#draft-ecc-quantum-recoverability]_.

The term below is to be interpreted as follows:

Unlinkability
  The property of statistical independence of signatures from the
  signers' long-term keys, ensuring that (for perfectly uniform
  generation of Randomizers and no leakage of metadata) it is
  impossible to determine whether two transactions were generated
  by the same party.


Abstract
========

This proposal adapts FROST [#FROST]_, a threshold signature scheme, to make it
support key re-randomization as described in [#protocol-abstractsigrerand]_.
This is a requirement in order for it to be used to implement unlinkable spend
authorization signatures in the Orchard and Sapling shielded protocols, as
deployed in Zcash.


Motivation
==========

In the Zcash protocol, Spend Authorization Signatures are employed to authorize
a transaction. The ability to generate these signatures with the user's private
key is what effectively allows the user to spend funds.

This is a security-critical step, since anyone who obtains access to the private
key will be able to spend the user's funds. For this reason, one interesting
possibility is to require multiple parties to allow the transaction to go
through. This can be accomplished with threshold signatures, where the private
key is split between parties (or generated already split using a distributed
protocol) in a way that a threshold (e.g. 2 out of 3) of them must sign the
transaction in order to create the final signature. This enables scenarios such
as users and third-party services sharing custody of a wallet, or a group of
people managing shared funds, for example.

FROST is one of such threshold signature protocols. However, it can't be used
as-is since the Zcash protocol also requires re-randomizing public and private
keys to ensure unlinkability between transactions. This ZIP specifies a variant
of FROST with re-randomization support. This variant is named "Re-Randomized
FROST" and has been described in [#frost-rerandomized]_.


Requirements
============

- All signatures generated by following this ZIP must be verified successfully
  as Sapling or Orchard spend authorization signatures using the appropriate
  validating key.
- The signatures generated by following this ZIP should meet the security
  criteria for Signature with Re-Randomizable Keys as specified in the Zcash
  protocol [#protocol-concretereddsa]_.
- The threat model described below must be taken into account.
- The key generation must be compatible with Quantum Recoverability
  [#draft-ecc-quantum-recoverability]_.

Threat Model
------------

In normal usage, a Zcash user follows multiple steps in order to generate a
shielded transaction:

- The transaction is created.
- The transaction is signed with a re-randomized version of the user's spend
  authorization private key.
- The zero-knowledge proof for the transaction is created with the randomizer
  as an auxiliary (secret) input, among others.

When employing re-randomizable FROST as specified in this ZIP, the goal is to
split the spend authorization private key $\mathsf{ask}$ among multiple possible
signers. This means that the proof generation will still be performed by a
single participant, likely the one that created the transaction in the first
place. Note that this user already controls the privacy of the transaction since
they are responsible for creating the proof.

This fits well into the "Coordinator" role from the FROST specification
[#frost-protocol]_. The Coordinator is responsible for sending the message to be
signed to all participants, and to aggregate the signature shares.

With those considerations in mind, the threat model considered in this ZIP is:

- The Coordinator is trusted with the privacy of the transaction (which includes
  the unlinkability property). A rogue Coordinator will be able to break
  unlinkability and privacy, but should not be able to create signed
  transactions without the approval of ``MIN_PARTICIPANTS`` participants, as
  specified in FROST.
- All key share holders are also trusted with the privacy of the transaction,
  thus a rogue key share holder will be able to break its privacy and
  unlinkability.

Caveats concerning the security model for use of FROST keys in a Quantum
Recovery protocol are covered in
[#draft-ecc-quantum-recoverability-usage-with-frost]_.


Non-requirements
================

- This ZIP does not support removing the Coordinator role, as described in
  [#frost-removingcoordinator]_.
- This ZIP does not prevent key share holders from linking the signing operation to a
  transaction in the blockchain.
- Like the FROST specification [#FROST]_, this ZIP does not specify a key generation
  procedure; but refer to that specification for guidelines.
- Network privacy is not in scope for this ZIP, and must be obtained with other
  tools if desired.


Specification
=============

Algorithms in this section are specified using Python pseudo-code, in the same
fashion as the FROST specification [#FROST]_.

We define the following as in [#FROST]_ for a specific FROST ciphersuite:

* Let $G$ be a group of prime order $p$ as described in [#frost-primeordergroup]_,
  with element type $\mathtt{Element}$, identity $I \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathtt{Element}$,
  base element $B \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathtt{Element}$ where $B \neq I$, and scalar type
  $\mathtt{Scalar} = \mathbb{F}_p$.
* Let $\mathtt{Ne}$ and $\mathtt{Ns}$ be the sizes in bytes of a serialized Element
  representation and Scalar representation, respectively.
* Let functions $\mathsf{Scalar} \;{\small ⦂}\; \{ 0 .. p-1 \} \rightarrow \mathtt{Scalar}$,
  $\mathsf{RandomScalar} \;{\small ⦂}\; () \stackrel{\tiny\mathrm{R}}{\rightarrow} \mathtt{Scalar}$,
  $\mathtt{ScalarMult} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathtt{Element} \times \mathtt{Scalar} \rightarrow \mathtt{Element}$,
  $\mathsf{ScalarBaseMult} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathtt{Scalar} \rightarrow \mathtt{Element}$,
  $\mathsf{SerializeElement} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathtt{Element} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}^{{\kern-0.05em\tiny\mathbb{Y}}[\mathtt{Ne}]}$,
  $\mathsf{DeserializeElement} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathbb{B}^{{\kern-0.05em\tiny\mathbb{Y}}[\mathtt{Ne}]} \rightarrow \mathtt{Element} \cup \{ \bot \}$,
  $\mathsf{SerializeScalar} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathtt{Scalar} \rightarrow \mathbb{B}^{{\kern-0.05em\tiny\mathbb{Y}}[\mathtt{Ns}]}$,
  $\mathsf{DeserializeScalar} \;{\small ⦂}\; \mathbb{B}^{{\kern-0.05em\tiny\mathbb{Y}}[\mathtt{Ns}]} \rightarrow \mathtt{Scalar} \cup \{ \bot \}$
  also be as described in [#frost-primeordergroup]_ (where "raising an error"
  corresponds to returning $\bot$).

Note that the notation for elliptic-curve scalar multiplication,
``G.ScalarMult(P, k)``, differs from that used in the Zcash Protocol
Specification, which would use $[k]\, P$ with the group implied by $P$
[#protocol-abstractgroup]_.


Key Generation
--------------

FROST key generation with a trusted dealer is described in [#frost-tdkg]_. That
description does not support key re-randomization but can be adapted to do so,
as described in section 5 of [#frost-rerandomized]_.

.. warning::
    Trusted dealer key generation has the severe disadvantage that it requires
    absolutely trustworthy hardware and software to be used by the dealer in
    order to reliably avoid exposing the private key material. That is, it is
    not sufficient simply to have an individual or organization that is trusted
    by all participants; their entire hardware and software stack also needs to
    be trusted by all participants.

    Since this will often be an unrealistic assumption that partly defeats the
    point of using a threshold signature scheme, trusted dealer key generation
    SHOULD NOT be used.

Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to instead use Distributed Key Generation. This is
supported by the Zcash Foundation's reference implementation of FROST
[#zf-frost-dkg]_.

To define a spending or viewing key that uses FROST, the Orchard and Sapling key
trees [#protocol-orchardkeycomponents]_ [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_ are
adjusted as follows:

- The Spend validating key $\mathsf{ak}$ is replaced by the FROST group
  public key `PK` [#frost-protocol]_ when deriving other key components.
- The Spend authorizing key $\mathsf{ask}$ [#protocol-spendauthsig]_ is
  replaced by the logical signing key that corresponds to the group public key
  `PK`. By design, this key is never explicitly constructed (unless trusted
  dealer key generation was used), and instead is represented by any sufficient
  subset of the participant FROST signing key shares `sk_i`.

For both Orchard and Sapling, use of Distributed Key Generation precludes
generating $\mathsf{ask}$ from a spending key $\mathsf{sk}$. Instead the
Distributed Key Generation protocol will output the FROST group public key `PK`.

When generating FROST key components for the Orchard shielded protocol, the
remaining parts of the Orchard key tree apart from $\mathsf{ask}$ and
$\mathsf{ak}$ SHOULD be generated as described in
[#draft-ecc-quantum-recoverability-usage-with-frost]_. The specification there
is normative, and is only summarized here. It requires the participants to
privately agree on a value $\mathsf{sk}$ (which is no longer sufficient by
itself for spend authorization), and then use it to obtain the nullifier
deriving key $\mathsf{nk}$, the quantum spending key $\mathsf{qsk}$, the quantum
intermediate key $\mathsf{qk}$, and (using the FROST group public key in place
of $\mathsf{ak}$) $\mathsf{rivk\_ext}$. This process is specified in § 4.2.3
‘Orchard Key Components’ [#protocol-orchardkeycomponents]_ as modified by
[#draft-ecc-quantum-recoverability-usage-with-frost]_.

Similarly, when generating a FROST key for the Sapling shielded protocol, the
remaining parts of the Sapling key tree apart from $\mathsf{ask}$ and
$\mathsf{ak}$ (that is, $\mathsf{nk}$, $\mathsf{rivk\_ext}$, and further values
derived from them and $\mathsf{ak}$) SHOULD be generated from a common value
$\mathsf{sk}$ (again, not sufficient by itself for spend authorization) as
described in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_.

If trusted dealer key generation is used contrary to recommendation, then
$\mathsf{ask}$ MAY in that case be derived from an $\mathsf{sk}$ known only to
the trusted dealer. This allows backing up the unsplit key, but any benefit of
being able to do so does not outweigh the disadvantages of requiring a trusted
dealer under normal circumstances.

Regardless of how the Orchard or Sapling key components are generated, the
participants MUST ensure that they have obtained the same values for
$\mathsf{ak}$, $\mathsf{nk}$, and $\mathsf{rivk\_ext}$.

Since Sapling will not be modified to support Quantum Recoverability
[#draft-ecc-quantum-recoverability]_, Orchard is RECOMMENDED for new FROST keys.

In order for all participants to agree on the value of $\mathsf{sk}$, one
of the following options SHOULD be carried out:

- One participant generates a random $\mathsf{sk}$ and sends it to the
  others via an encrypted and authenticated channel. This option SHOULD be used
  if trusted dealer key generation was used, and the $\mathsf{sk}$ value
  can be sent along with the FROST shares during key generation. This option MAY
  be used if Distributed Key Generation was used, if participants find it
  acceptable to trust one participant to correctly generate $\mathsf{sk}$.
- Participants generate a $\mathsf{sk}$ in distributed manner using TODO.
  This option SHOULD be used if Distributed Key Generation was used.


Randomizer Generation
---------------------

Re-Randomized FROST uses randomizers. This section specifies how they are
generated; this will be required for the Signature Share Generation
specification below.

Two functions are provided to generate randomizers: `randomizer_generate()` and
`randomizer_regenerate()`. Both use helper functions and a constant which are
defined as follows:

- The `encode_group_commitment_list()` function is defined in
  [#frost-listoperations]_. It returns a byte serialization of a
  `commitment_list` value.
- The `random_bytes(n)` function is defined in [#frost-conventions]_ and it
  returns a sequence of `n` bytes sampled uniformly at random.
- The `H2(m)` function is a ciphersuite-generic function defined in
  [#frost-hash]_ but it is instantiated in the `Ciphersuites`_ section.

::

  randomizer_generate():

  Inputs:
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i,
    binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list of commitments issued by
    each participant, where each element in the list indicates a
    NonZeroScalar identifier i and two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list
    MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.

  Outputs: (randomizer_seed, randomizer), a byte sequence and a Scalar

  def randomizer_generate(commitment_list):
    # Generate a random byte sequence with the size of a serialized scalar.
    randomizer_seed = random_bytes(Ns)
    signing_commitments_enc = encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list)
    randomizer_input = randomizer_seed || signing_commitments_enc
    return (randomizer_seed, H2(randomizer_input))

::

  randomizer_regenerate():

  Inputs:
  - randomizer_seed = a sequence of Ns bytes
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i,
    binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list of commitments issued by
    each participant, where each element in the list indicates a
    NonZeroScalar identifier i and two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list
    MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.

  Outputs: randomizer, a Scalar

  def randomizer_regenerate(randomizer_seed, commitment_list):
    signing_commitments_enc = encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list)
    randomizer_input = randomizer_seed || signing_commitments_enc
    return H2(randomizer_input)


Re-Randomized FROST
-------------------

To add re-randomization to FROST, the signers MUST follow the specification
[#FROST]_ with the following modifications.


Round One - Commitment
''''''''''''''''''''''

Round One is exactly the same as specified [#FROST]_. But for context, it
involves these steps:

- Each signer generates nonces and their corresponding public commitments.
  A nonce is a pair of Scalar values, and a commitment is a pair of Element values.
- The nonces are stored locally by the signer and kept private for use in the
  second round.
- The commitments are sent to the Coordinator.


Round Two - Signature Share Generation
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In Round Two of regular FROST, the Coordinator picks a message and sends it to
each signer along with the commitments received in Round One. In Re-Randomized
FROST, the Coordinator MUST additionally call `randomizer_generate()` and send
the `randomizer_seed` along with the message and the commitments. Each
participant, upon receiving those values, MUST compute `randomizer` by calling
`randomizer_regenerate()` with the received `randomizer_seed` and commitments.

In Zcash, the message that needs to be signed is the SIGHASH transaction hash.
This by itself does not convey enough information for the signers to decide
whether they want to authorize the transaction or not. Therefore, in addition
to the serialized transaction, more data (such as openings of value commitments,
decryption of note ciphertexts, etc.) needs to be sent from the Coordinator to
the signers. This SHOULD be done by sending a Partially Constructed Zcash Transaction
[#draft-zip-0374]_ over the same encrypted, authenticated channel. In order to sign,
each signer MUST be satisfied that the transaction should be authorized, using
the additional information provided in the PCZT where necessary. That information
MUST be checked for consistency with the transaction and not trusted simply
because the Coordinator is providing it.

The details of this checking, and of what needs to be included in the PCZT in
order for the signers to be satisfied that the transaction should be authorized,
are to be specified in [#draft-zip-0374]_.

Let ``FROST.sign`` be the regular FROST signing function with arguments
``(identifier, sk_i, group_public_key, nonce_i, msg, commitment_list)``,
as defined in [#frost-sign]_.

The ``Rerandomized-FROST.sign`` function takes an additional input
``randomizer_seed``, and adjusts the inputs relative to the ``randomizer``
computed by ``randomizer_regenerate()``::

  def Rerandomized-FROST.sign(identifier, sk_i, group_public_key, nonce_i, msg,
                              commitment_list, randomizer_seed):
    randomizer = randomizer_regenerate(randomizer_seed, commitment_list)
    randomized_sk_i = sk_i + randomizer
    randomized_group_public_key = group_public_key + G.ScalarBaseMult(randomizer)
    return FROST.sign(identifier, randomized_sk_i, randomized_group_public_key,
                      nonce_i, msg, commitment_list)

The signer MAY cache ``randomizer`` and ``G.ScalarBaseMult(randomizer)`` for
use in the ``Rerandomized-FROST.{aggregate, verify_signature_share}`` functions
defined below.


Signature Share Verification and Aggregation
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Let ``FROST.aggregate`` be the regular FROST aggregation function with
arguments ``(commitment_list, msg, group_public_key, sig_shares)``, as
defined in [#frost-aggregate]_.

The ``Rerandomized-FROST.aggregate`` function takes an additional input
``randomizer`` computed as above, and adjusts the inputs relative to this
randomizer::

 def Rerandomized-FROST.aggregate(commitment_list, msg, group_public_key, sig_shares,
                                  randomizer):
   randomized_group_public_key = group_public_key + G.ScalarBaseMult(randomizer)
   return FROST.aggregate(commitment_list, msg, randomized_group_public_key, sig_shares)

Similarly, let ``FROST.verify_signature_share`` be the regular FROST signature
share verification function with arguments
``(identifier, PK_i, comm_i, sig_share_i, commitment_list, group_public_key, msg)``,
as defined also in [#frost-aggregate]_.

The ``Rerandomized-FROST.verify_signature_share`` function takes an additional
input ``randomizer`` computed as above, and adjusts the inputs relative to this
randomizer::

  def Rerandomized-FROST.verify_signature_share(identifier, PK_i, comm_i, sig_share_i,
                                                commitment_list, group_public_key, msg):
    group_offset = G.ScalarBaseMult(randomizer)
    randomized_PK_i = PK_i + group_offset
    randomized_group_public_key = group_public_key + group_offset
    return FROST.verify_signature_share(identifier, randomized_PK_i, comm_i, sig_share_i,
                                        commitment_list, randomized_group_public_key, msg)


Ciphersuites
------------

FROST(Jubjub, BLAKE2b-512)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This ciphersuite uses Jubjub for the Group and BLAKE2b-512 for the Hash function ``H``
meant to produce signatures indistinguishable from RedJubjub Sapling Spend

for RedPallas.

Rationale
=========

FROST is a threshold Schnorr signature scheme, and Zcash Spend Authorization are
also Schnorr signatures, which allows the usage of FROST with Zcash. However,
since there is no widespread standard for Schnorr signatures, it must be ensured
that the signatures generated by the FROST variant specified in this ZIP can be
verified successfully by a Zcash implementation following its specification. In
practice this entails making sure that the generated signature can be verified
by the $\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}$ function specified in
[#protocol-concretereddsa]_:

- The FROST signature, when split into $R$ and $S$ in the first step of
  $\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}$, must yield the values expected by the
  function. This is ensured by defining $\mathsf{SerializeElement}$ and
  $\mathsf{SerializeScalar}$ in each ciphersuite to yield those values.

- The challenge $c$ used during FROST signing must be equal to the challenge
  $c$ computed during $\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}$. This requires defining the
  ciphersuite H2 function as the $\mathsf{H}^\circledast(m)$ Zcash
  function in the ciphersuites, and making sure its input will be the same.
  Fortunately FROST and Zcash use the same input order ($R$, public key, message)
  so we just need to make sure that $\mathsf{SerializeElement}$ (used to compute
  the encoded public key before passing to the hash function) matches what
  $\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}$ expects; which is possible since both $R$ and
  $\mathsf{vk}$ (the public key) are encoded in the same way as in Zcash.

- Note that $r$ (and thus $R$) will not be generated as specified in
  $\mathsf{RedDSA.Sign}$. This is not an issue however, since with Schnorr
  signatures it does not matter for the verifier how the $r$ value was chosen,
  it just needs to be a uniformly distributed random element, which is true for
  FROST.

- The above will ensure that the verification equation in
  $\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}$ will pass, since FROST ensures the exact same
  equation will be valid as described in [#frost-primeorderverify]_.

The second step is adding the re-randomization functionality so that each FROST
signing generates a re-randomized signature:

- Anywhere the public key is used, the randomized public key must be used instead.
  This is exactly what is done in the functions defined above.
- The re-randomization must be done in each signature share generation, such
  that the aggregated signature must be valid under verification with the
  randomized public key. This is shown to be true in [#frost-rerandomized]_.

- The re-randomization procedure must be exactly the same as in
  [#protocol-concretereddsa]_ to ensure that re-randomized keys are uniformly
  distributed and signatures are unlinkable. This is also true; observe that
  ``randomizer_generate`` generates randomizer uniformly at random as required
  by $\mathsf{RedDSA.GenRandom}$; and signature generation is compatible
  with $\mathsf{RedDSA.RandomizePrivate}$,
  $\mathsf{RedDSA.RandomizePublic}$, $\mathsf{RedDSA.Sign}$ and
  $\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}$ as explained in the previous item.

The security of Re-Randomized FROST with respect to the security assumptions of
regular FROST is shown in [#frost-rerandomized]_.

Regarding randomizer handling, in Zcash, the `randomizer` is called $\alpha$
and is usually generated using the $\mathsf{RedDSA.GenRandom}$ function as
defined in the Zcash specification [#protocol-spendauthsig]_. Note that the
choice of $\alpha$ influences the SIGHASH computation, so it is impossible
to compute the `randomizer` based on the message (SIGHASH), as suggested in
[#frost-rerandomized]_. This is not an issue as long as the `randomizer` is
generated with the same security properties as $\mathsf{RedDSA.GenRandom}$.
We ensure that by using a very similar approach; while the original
$\mathsf{RedDSA.GenRandom}$ uses $\mathsf{H}^\circledast(T)$ where $T$ is a
random byte sequence with a certain size, in this ZIP we effectively use
$\mathsf{H}^\circledast(T || \mathsf{signing\_commitments\_enc})$, i.e. we
concatenate the random bytes with the encoding of the signing commitments.
This preserves the security assumptions and also hedges against issues in the
Coordinator random byte generator and prevents the Coordinator from fully
influencing the randomizer, reducing its trust assumptions.


Reference implementation
========================

The `reddsa` crate [#crate-reddsa]_ contains a re-randomized FROST implementation
of both ciphersuites.

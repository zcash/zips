Terminology
===========

{Edit this to reflect the key words that are actually used.}
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [#RFC2119]_

The terms below are to be interpreted as follows:

Unlinkability
  The property of statistical independence of signatures from the
  signers' long-term keys, ensuring that (for perfectly uniform
  generation of Randomizers and no leakage of metadata) it is
  impossible to determine whether two transactions were generated
  by the same party.


Abstract
========

This proposal adapts FROST [#FROST]_, a threshold signature scheme,
to make it unlinkable, which is a requirement for its use in the Zcash protocol.
The adapted scheme generates signatures compatible with spend authorization
signatures in the Sapling and Orchard shielded protocols as deployed in Zcash.


Motivation
==========

In the Zcash protocol, Spend Authorization Signatures are employed to authorize
a transaction. The ability to generate these signatures with the user's
private key is what effectively allows the user to spend funds.

This is a security-critical step, since anyone who obtains access to the private
key will be able to spend the user's funds. For this reason, one interesting
possibility is to require multiple parties to allow the transaction to go
through. This can be accomplished with threshold signatures, where the private
key is split between parties (or generated already split using a distributed
protocol) in a way that a threshold (e.g. 2 out of 3) of them must sign the
transaction in order to create the final signature. This enables scenarios such
as users and third-party services sharing custody of a wallet, or a group of
people managing shared funds, for example.

FROST is one of such threshold signature protocols. However, it can't be used
as-is since the Zcash protocol also requires re-randomizing public and private
keys to ensure unlinkability between transactions. This ZIP specifies a variant
of FROST with re-randomization support. This variant is named "Re-Randomized
FROST" and has been described in [#frost-rerandomized]_.


Requirements
============

- All signatures generated by following this ZIP must be verified successfully
  as Sapling or Orchard spend authorization signatures using the appropriate
  validating key.
- The signatures generated by following this ZIP should meet the security
  criteria for Signature with Re-Randomizable Keys as specified in the Zcash
  protocol [#protocol-concretereddsa]_.
- The threat model described below must be taken into account.

Threat Model
------------

In normal usage, a Zcash user follows multiple steps in order to generate a
shielded transaction:

- The transaction is created.
- The transaction is signed with a re-randomized version of the user's spend
  authorization private key.
- The zero-knowledge proof for the transaction is created with the randomizer
  as an auxiliary (secret) input, among others.

When employing re-randomizable FROST as specified in this ZIP, the goal is to
split the spend authorization private key :math:`\mathsf{ask}` among multiple
possible signers. This means that the proof generation will still be performed
by a single participant, likely the one that created the transaction in the first
place. Note that this user already controls the privacy of the transaction since
they are responsible for creating the proof.

This fits well into the "Coordinator" role from the FROST specification
[#frost-protocol]_. The Coordinator is responsible for sending the message to be
signed to all participants, and to aggregate the signature shares.

With those considerations in mind, the threat model considered in this ZIP is:

- The Coordinator is trusted with the privacy of the transaction (which includes
  the unlinkability property). A rogue Coordinator will be able to break
  unlinkability and privacy, but should not be able to create signed transactions
  without the approval of ``MIN_PARTICIPANTS`` participants, as specified in FROST.
- All key share holders are also trusted with the privacy of the transaction,
  thus a rogue key share holder will be able to break its privacy and unlinkability.


Non-requirements
================

- This ZIP does not support removing the Coordinator role, as described in
  [#frost-removingcoordinator]_.
- This ZIP does not prevent key share holders from linking the signing operation to a
  transaction in the blockchain.
- Like the FROST specification [#FROST]_, this ZIP does not specify a key generation
  procedure; but refer to that specification for guidelines.
- Network privacy is not in scope for this ZIP, and must be obtained with other
  tools if desired.


Specification
=============

Algorithms in this section are specified using Python pseudo-code, in the same
fashion as the FROST specification [#FROST]_.

The types Scalar, Element, and G are defined in [#frost-primeordergroup]_, as
well as the notation for elliptic-curve arithmetic, which uses the additive
notation. Note that this notation differs from that used in the Zcash Protocol
Specification. For example, ``G.ScalarMult(P, k)`` is used for scalar
multiplication, where the protocol spec would use :math:`[k] P` with the group
implied by :math:`P`.

An additional per-ciphersuite hash function is used, denote ``HR(m)``, which
receives an arbitrary-sized byte string and returns a Scalar. It is defined
concretely in the Ciphersuites section.


Key Generation
--------------

While key generation is out of scope for this ZIP and the FROST spec [#FROST]_,
it needs to be consistent with FROST, see [#frost-tdkg]_ for guidance. The spend
authorization private key :math:`\mathsf{ask}` [#protocol-spendauthsig]_ is the
particular key that must be used in the context of this ZIP. Note that the
:math:`\mathsf{ask}` is usually derived from the spending key
:math:`\mathsf{sk}`, though that is not required. Not doing so allows using
distributed key generation, since the key it generates is unpredictable. Note
however that not deriving :math:`\mathsf{ask}` from :math:`\mathsf{sk}` prevents
using seed phrases to recover the original secret (which may be something
desirable in the context of FROST).


Re-randomizable FROST
---------------------

To add re-randomization to FROST, follow the specification [#FROST]_ with the
following modifications.


Randomizer Generation
'''''''''''''''''''''

A new helper function is defined, which generates a randomizer. The
`encode_signing_package` is defined as the byte serialization of the `msg`,
`commitment_list` values as described in [#frost-serialization]_.
Implementations MAY choose another encoding as long as all values (the message,
and the identifier, binding nonce and hiding nonce for each participant) are
unambiguously encoded.

The function `random_bytes(n)` is defined in [#FROST]_ and it returns a buffer
with `n` bytes sampled uniformly at random. The constant `Ns` is also specified
in [#FROST]_ and is the size of a serialized scalar.

::

  randomizer_generate():

  Inputs:
  - msg, the message being signed in the current FROST signing run
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i,
    binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list of commitments issued by
    each participant, where each element in the list indicates a
    NonZeroScalar identifier i and two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list
    MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.

  Outputs: randomizer, a Scalar

  def randomizer_generate(msg, commitment_list):
    # Generate a random byte buffer with the size of a serialized scalar
    rng_randomizer = random_bytes(Ns)
    signing_package_enc = encode_signing_package(commitment_list, msg)
    randomizer_input = rng_randomizer || signing_package_enc
    return HR(randomizer_input)


Round One - Commitment
''''''''''''''''''''''

Roune One is exactly the same as specified [#FROST]_. But for context, it
involves these steps:

- Each signer generates nonces and their corresponding public commitments.
  A nonce is a pair of Scalar values, and a commitment is a pair of Element values.
- The nonces are stored locally by the signer and kept private for use in the second round.
- The commitments are sent to the Coordinator.


Round Two - Signature Share Generation
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In Round Two, the Coordinator generates a random scalar ``randomizer`` by calling
``randomizer_generate`` and sends it to each signer, over a confidential and
authenticated channel, along with the message and the set of signing
commitments. (Note that this differs from regular FROST which just requires an
authenticated channel.)

In Zcash, the message that needs to be signed is actually the SIGHASH
transaction hash, which does not convey enough information for the signers to
decide if they want to authorize the transaction or not. Therefore, in practice,
more data is needed to be sent (over the same encrypted, authenticated channel)
from the Coordinator to the signers, possibly the transaction itself, openings of
value commitments, decryption of note ciphertexts, etc.; and the signers MUST check
that the given SIGHASH matches the data sent from the Coordinator, or compute the
SIGHASH themselves from that data. However, the specific mechanism for that process
is outside the scope of this ZIP.

The randomized ``sign`` function is defined as the regular FROST ``sign``
function, but with its inputs modified relative to the ``randomizer`` as
following:

- ``sk_i = sk_i + randomizer``
- ``group_public_key = group_public_key + G.ScalarBaseMult(randomizer)``


Signature Share Verification and Aggregation
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The randomized ``aggregate`` function is defined as the regular FROST
``aggregate`` function, but with its inputs modified relative to the
``randomizer`` as following:

- ``group_public_key = group_public_key + G.ScalarBaseMult(randomizer)``

The randomized ``verify_signature_share`` function is defined as the regular
FROST ``verify_signature_share`` function, but with its inputs modified relative
to the ``randomizer`` as following:

- ``PK_i = PK_i + G.ScalarBaseMult(randomizer)``
- ``group_public_key = group_public_key + G.ScalarBaseMult(randomizer)``


Ciphersuites
------------

FROST(Jubjub, BLAKE2b-512)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This ciphersuite uses Jubjub for the Group and BLAKE2b-512 for the Hash function ``H``

for RedPallas.

Rationale
=========

FROST is a threshold Schnorr signature scheme, and Zcash Spend Authorization are
also Schnorr signatures, which allows the usage of FROST with Zcash. However,
since there is no widespread standard for Schnorr signatures, it must be ensured
that the signatures generated by the FROST variant specified in this ZIP can be
verified successfully by a Zcash implementation following its specification. In
practice this entails making sure that the generated signature can be verified
by the :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}` function specified in
[#protocol-concretereddsa]_:

- The FROST signature, when split into R and S in the first step of
  :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}`, must yield the values expected by the
  function. This is ensured by defining SerializeElement and SerializeScalar in
  each ciphersuite to yield those values.

- The challenge c used during FROST signing must be equal to the challenge c
  computed during :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}`. This requires defining the
  ciphersuite H2 function as the :math:`\mathsf{H}^\circledast(m)` Zcash
  function in the ciphersuites, and making sure its input will be the same.
  Fortunately FROST and Zcash use the same input order (R, public key, message)
  so we just need to make sure that SerializeElement (used to compute the
  encoded public key before passing to the hash function) matches what
  :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}` expects; which is possible since both `R` and
  `vk` (the public key) are encoded in the same way as in Zcash.

- Note that ``r`` (and thus ``R``) will not be generated as specified in RedDSA.Sign.
  This is not an issue however, since with Schnorr signatures it does not matter
  for the verifier how the ``r`` value was chosen, it just needs to be generated
  uniformly at random, which is true for FROST.

- The above will ensure that the verification equation in
  :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}` will pass, since FROST ensures the exact same
  equation will be valid as described in [#frost-primeorderverify]_.

The second step is adding the re-randomization functionality so that each FROST
signing generates a re-randomized signature:

- Anywhere the public key is used, the randomized public key must be used instead.
  This is exactly what is done in the functions defined above.
- The re-randomization must be done in each signature share generation, such
  that the aggregated signature must be valid under verification with the
  randomized public key. The ``R`` value from the signature is not influenced by
  the randomizer so we just need to focus on the ``z`` value (using FROST
  notation). Recall that ``z`` must equal to ``r + (c * sk)``, and that each
  signature share is ``z_i = (hiding_nonce + (binding_nonce * binding_factor)) +
  (lambda_i * c * sk_i)``. The first terms are not influenced by the randomizer
  so we can only look into the second term of each top-level addition, i.e. ``c
  * sk`` must be equal to ``sum(lambda_i * c * sk_i)`` for each participant
  ``i``. Under re-randomization these become ``c * (sk + randomizer)`` (see
  :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.RandomizedPrivate}`, which refers to the randomizer as
  :math:`\alpha`) and ``sum(lambda_i * c * (sk_i + randomizer))``. The latter
  can be rewritten as ``c * (sum(lambda_i * sk_i) + randomizer *
  sum(lambda_i)``. Since ``sum(lambda_i * sk_i) == sk`` per the Shamir secret
  sharing mechanism used by FROST, and since ``sum(lambda_i) == 1``
  [#sum-lambda-proof]_, we arrive at ``c * (sk + randomizer)`` as required.

- The re-randomization procedure must be exactly the same as in
  [#protocol-concretereddsa]_ to ensure that re-randomized keys are uniformly
  distributed and signatures are unlinkable. This is also true; observe that
  ``randomizer_generate`` generates randomizer uniformly at random as required
  by :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.GenRandom}`; and signature generation is compatible
  with :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.RandomizedPrivate}`,
  :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.RandomizedPublic}`, :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.Sign}` and
  :math:`\mathsf{RedDSA.Validate}` as explained in the previous item.

The security of Re-Randomized FROST with respect to the security assumptions of
regular FROST is shown in [#frost-rerandomized]_.


Reference implementation
========================

The `reddsa` crate [#crate-reddsa]_ contains a re-randomized FROST implementation of
both ciphersuites.

Abstract
========

This ZIP describes a proposed specification for a standardized format for clients who wish
to transmit or receive content within the encrypted memo field of shielded transactions.

Motivation
==========

A well-defined standard for formatting content within the encrypted memo field will help
expand its use within the Zcash ecosystem by providing a commonly recognized format for
memo values carrying different types of data. Users and third-party services benefit from
standardized formatting rules that define the type and length of the data contained within.

Specification
=============

Section 5.5 of the Zcash protocol specification [#protocol]_ defines three cases
for the encoding of a memo field:

* a UTF-8 human-readable string [#UTF-8]_, padded by appending zero bytes; or
* the byte ``0xF6`` followed by 511 ``0x00`` bytes, indicating "no memo"; or
* any other sequence of 512 bytes starting with a byte value ``0xF5`` or greater (which is
  therefore not a valid UTF-8 string), as specified in ZIP 302.

This ZIP refines the specification of the third case.

The following specification constrains a party, called the "reader", that interprets the
contents of a memo. It does not define consensus requirements.

+ If the first byte (byte 0) has a value of ``0xF4`` or smaller, then the reader MUST:

     + strip any trailing zero bytes
     + decode it as a UTF-8 string (if decoding fails then report an error).

+ If the first byte has a value of ``0xF6``, and the remaining 511 bytes are ``0x00``,
  then the user supplied no memo, and the encrypted memo field is to be treated as empty.

+ If the memo matches any of these patterns, then this memo is from the future, because
  these ranges are reserved for future updates to this specification:

     + The first byte has a value of ``0xF6``, and the remaining 511 bytes are not all
       ``0x00``.
     + The first byte has a value between ``0xF7`` and ``0xFE`` inclusive.

+ If the first byte has a value of ``0xFF`` then the reader should not make any other
  assumption about the memo. In order to put arbitrary data into a memo field (that
  might have some private non-standard structure), the value of the first byte SHOULD
  be set to 0xFF; the remaining 511 bytes are then unconstrained.

+ If the first byte has a value of ``0xF5``, then the reader should not make any other
  assumption about the memo. This value was used ambiguously in the past by private
  agreement; applications SHOULD prefer ``0xFF`` which is unambiguously for this purpose.

Rationale
=========

The new protocol specification is an improvement over the current memo field content
specification that was in the protocol spec up to version 2020.1.0, which stated:

    The usage of the memo field is by agreement between the sender and recipient of the
    note. The memo field SHOULD be encoded either as:

    + a UTF-8 human-readable string [Unicode], padded by appending zero bytes; or
    + an arbitrary sequence of 512 bytes starting with a byte value of ``0xF5`` or
      greater, which is therefore not a valid UTF-8 string.

    In the former case, wallet software is expected to strip any trailing zero bytes and
    then display the resulting UTF-8 string to the recipient user, where applicable.
    Incorrect UTF-8-encoded byte sequences should be displayed as replacement characters
    (``U+FFFD``).

    In the latter case, the contents of the memo field SHOULD NOT be displayed. A start
    byte of ``0xF5`` is reserved for use by automated software by private agreement. A
    start byte of ``0xF6`` or greater is reserved for use in future Zcash protocol
    extensions.

See issue `#1849`_ for further discussion.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Encrypted memo field contents sent without the standardized format proposed here will be
interpreted according to the specification set out in older versions of the protocol spec.

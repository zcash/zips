Abstract
========

This ZIP proposes the allocation of a percentage of the Zcash block subsidy,
post-November 2024 halving, split between Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) and an
in-protocol "lockbox." The "lockbox" is a separate pool of issued funds tracked
by the protocol, as described in ZIP 2001: Lockbox Funding Streams [#zip-2001]_.
No disbursement mechanism is currently defined for this "lockbox"; the Zcash
community will need to decide upon and specify a suitable decentralized
mechanism for permitting withdrawals from this lockbox in a future ZIP in order
to make these funds available for funding grants to ecosystem participants.

The proposed lockbox addresses significant issues observed with ZIP 1014
[#zip-1014]_, such as regulatory risks, inefficiencies due to funding of
organizations instead of projects, and centralization. While the exact
disbursement mechanism for the lockbox funds is yet to be determined and will be
addressed in a future ZIP, the goal is to employ a decentralized mechanism that
ensures community involvement and efficient, project-specific funding. This
approach is intended to potentially improve regulatory compliance, reduce
inefficiencies, and enhance the decentralization of Zcash's funding structure.


Motivation
==========

Starting at Zcash's second halving in November 2024, under pre-existing
consensus rules 100% of the block subsidies would be allocated to miners, and no
further funds would be automatically allocated to any other entities.
Consequently, unless the community takes action to approve new
block-subsidy-based funding, existing teams dedicated to development or outreach
or furthering charitable, educational, or scientific purposes would likely need
to seek other sources of funding; failure to obtain such funding would likely
impair their ability to continue serving the Zcash ecosystem. Setting aside a
portion of the block subsidy to fund development will help ensure that both
existing teams and new contributors can obtain funding in the future.

It is important to balance the incentives for securing the consensus protocol
through mining with funding crucial charitable, educational, and scientific
activities like research, development, and outreach. Additionally, there is a
need to continue to promote decentralization and the growth of independent
development teams.

For these reasons, the Zcash Community wishes to establish a new Zcash
Development Fund after the second halving in November 2024, with the intent to
put in place a more decentralized mechanism for allocation of development
funds. The alternatives presented here are intended to address the following:

1. **Regulatory Risks**: The current model involves direct funding of US-based
   organizations, which can potentially attract regulatory scrutiny from
   entities such as the SEC, posing legal risks to the Zcash ecosystem.

2. **Funding Inefficiencies**: The current model directly funds organizations
   rather than specific projects, leading to a potential mismatch between those
   organizations' development priorities and the priorities of the community.
   Furthermore, if organizations are guaranteed funds regardless of
   performance, there is little incentive to achieve key performance indicators
   (KPIs) or align with community sentiment. A future system that allocates
   resources directly to projects rather than organizations may help reduce
   inefficiencies and better align development efforts with community
   priorities.

3. **Centralization Concerns**: The current model centralizes decision-making
   power within a few organizations, contradicting the decentralized ethos of
   blockchain technology. Traditional organizational structures with boards and
   executives introduce single points of failure and limit community
   involvement in funding decisions.

4. **Community Involvement**: The current system provides minimal formal input
   from the community regarding what projects should be funded, leading to a
   misalignment between funded projects and community priorities.

5. **Moving Towards a Non-Direct Funding Model**: There is strong community
   support for a non-direct Dev Fund funding model. Allocating funds to a
   Deferred Dev Fund Lockbox incentivizes the development of a decentralized
   mechanism for the disbursement of the locked funds.

6. **Limited Runway**: ZCG does not have the financial runway that ECC/BP and ZF
   have. As such, allocating ongoing funding to ZCG will help ensure the Zcash
   ecosystem has an active grants program.

7. **Promoting Decentralization**: Allocating a portion of the Dev Fund to Zcash
   Community Grants ensures small teams continue to receive funding to
   contribute to Zcash. Allowing the Dev Fund to expire, or putting 100% into a
   lockbox, would disproportionately impact grant recipients. This hybrid
   approach promotes decentralization and the growth of independent development
   teams.

8. **Mitigating Regulatory Risks**: The Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF) is a
   non-profit organization incorporated and based in the Cayman Islands. By
   minimizing direct funding of US-based organizations, this proposal helps to
   reduce potential regulatory scrutiny and legal risks.

By addressing these issues, this proposal aims to ensure sustainable,
efficient, and decentralized funding for essential activities within the Zcash
ecosystem.


Requirements
============

1. **In-Protocol Lockbox**: The alternatives presented in this ZIP depend upon
   the Lockbox Funding Streams proposal [#zip-2001]_.

2. **Regulatory Considerations**: The allocation of funds should minimize
   regulatory risks by avoiding direct funding of specific organizations. The
   design should enable and encourage compliance with applicable laws and regulations to
   support the long-term sustainability of the funding model.


Non-requirements
================

The following considerations are explicitly deferred to future ZIPs and are not
covered by this proposal:

1. **Disbursement Mechanism**: The exact method for disbursing the accumulated
   funds from the lockbox is not defined in this ZIP. The design,
   implementation, and governance of the disbursement mechanism will be
   addressed in a future ZIP. This includes specifics on how funds will be
   allocated, the voting or decision-making process, and the structure of the
   decentralized mechanism (such as a DAO).

2. **Regulatory Compliance Details**: The proposal outlines the potential to
   reduce regulatory risks by avoiding direct funding of US-based
   organizations, but it does not detail specific regulatory compliance
   strategies. Future ZIPs will need to address how the disbursement mechanism
   complies with applicable laws and regulations.

3. **Impact Assessment**: The long-term impact of reallocating a portion of the
   block subsidy to the lockbox on the Zcash ecosystem, including its effect on
   miners, developers, and the broader community, is not analyzed in this ZIP.
   Subsequent proposals will need to evaluate the outcomes and make necessary
   adjustments based on real-world feedback and data.


Specification
=============

Development Funding Recipients
------------------------------

Lockbox
'''''''

The "lockbox" is a pool of issued funds tracked by the protocol, as described in
ZIP 2001: Lockbox Funding Streams [#zip-2001]_. No disbursement mechanism is
currently defined for this "lockbox"; the Zcash community will need to decide
upon and specify a suitable decentralized mechanism for permitting withdrawals
from this lockbox in a future ZIP in order to make these funds available for
funding grants to ecosystem participants.

Zcash Community Grants (ZCG)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The stream allocated to Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) is intended to fund
independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing
development (or other work) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem, to the
extent that such teams are available and effective. The ZCG Committee is given
the discretion to allocate funds not only to major grants, but also to a
diverse range of projects that advance the usability, security, privacy, and
adoption of Zcash, including community programs, dedicated resources, and other
projects of varying sizes.

The funds SHALL be received and administered by the Financial Privacy Foundation
(FPF). FPF MUST disburse them for grants and expenses reasonably related to the
administration of the ZCG program, but subject to the following additional
constraints:

1. These funds MUST be used exclusively for issuing Zcash Community Grants to
   external parties that are independent of the FPF or to Autonomous Entities
   operating under the FPF umbrella. Additionally, they MAY be used to cover
   expenses reasonably related to the administration of Zcash Community Grants.
   These funds MUST NOT be used by FPF for its internal operations or for any
   direct expenses unrelated to the administration of Zcash Community Grants.

2. ZCG SHOULD support well-specified work proposed by the grantee, at
   reasonable market-rate costs. They can be of any duration or ongoing without
   a duration limit. Grants of indefinite duration SHOULD be reviewed
   periodically (on a schedule that the Zcash Community Grants Committee
   considers appropriate for the value and complexity of the grant) for
   continuation of funding.

3. Priority SHOULD be given to major grants that bolster teams with substantial
   (current or prospective) continual existence, and set them up for long-term
   success, subject to the usual grant award considerations (impact, ability,
   risks, team, cost-effectiveness, etc.). Priority SHOULD be given to major
   grants that support ecosystem growth, for example through mentorship,
   coaching, technical resources, creating entrepreneurial opportunities, etc.
   If one proposal substantially duplicates another’s plans, priority SHOULD be
   given to the originator of the plans.

4. The ZCG committee SHOULD be restricted to funding projects that further the
   Zcash cryptocurrency and its ecosystem (which is more specific than
   furthering financial privacy in general) as permitted by
   any relevant jurisdictional requirements.

5. ZCG awards are subject to approval by a five-seat ZCG Committee. The ZCG
   Committee SHALL be selected by the ZF’s Community Advisory Panel or a
   successor process (e.g. as established by FPF). Elections SHALL be staggered
   to ensure continuity within the Committee.

6. The ZCG Committee's funding decisions will be final, requiring no approval
   from the FPF Board, but are subject to veto if FPF judges them to violate
   Cayman law or the FPF's reporting requirements and other (current or future)
   obligations under the Cayman Islands' Companies Act (2023 Revision) and
   Foundation Companies Law, 2017.

7. ZCG Committee members SHALL have a one-year term and MAY sit for reelection.
   The ZCG Committee is subject to the same conflict of interest policy that
   governs the FPF Board of Directors (i.e. they MUST recuse themselves when
   voting on proposals where they have a financial interest). At most one
   person with association with the BP/ECC, at most one person with
   association with the ZF, and at most one person with association with FPF
   are allowed to sit on the ZCG Committee.
   “Association” here means: having a financial interest, full-time employment,
   being an officer, being a director, or having an immediate family
   relationship with any of the above.

8. A portion of the ZCG Slice shall be allocated to a Discretionary Budget,
   which may be disbursed for expenses reasonably related to the administration
   of the ZCG program. The amount of funds allocated to the Discretionary
   Budget SHALL be decided by the ZF’s Community Advisory Panel or successor
   process. Any disbursement of funds from the Discretionary Budget MUST be
   approved by the ZCG Committee. Expenses related to the administration of the
   ZCG program include, without limitation the following:

    * Paying for operational management and administration services that
      support the purpose of the Zcash Community Grants program, including
      administration services provided by FPF.
    * Paying third party vendors for services related to domain name
      registration, or the design, website hosting and administration of
      websites for the ZCG Committee.
    * Paying independent consultants to develop requests for proposals that
      align with the ZCG program.
    * Paying independent consultants for expert review of grant applications.
    * Paying for sales and marketing services to promote the ZCG program.
    * Paying third party consultants to undertake activities that support the
      purpose of the ZCG program.
    * Reimbursement to members of the ZCG Committee for reasonable travel
      expenses, including transportation, hotel and meals allowance.

9. A portion of the Discretionary Budget MAY be allocated to provide reasonable
   compensation to members of the ZCG Committee. Committee member compensation
   SHALL be limited to the hours needed to successfully perform their positions
   and MUST align with the scope and responsibilities of their roles. The
   allocation and distribution of compensation to committee members SHALL be
   administered by the FPF. The compensation rate and hours for committee
   members SHALL be determined by the ZF’s Community Advisory Panel or
   successor process.

10. The ZCG Committee’s decisions relating to the allocation and disbursement
    of funds from the Discretionary Budget will be final, requiring no approval
    from the FPF Board, but are subject to veto if the FPF judges
    them to violate laws or FPF reporting requirements and other
    (current or future) obligations under Cayman Islands law.

FPF SHALL be contractually required to recognize the ZCG slice of the Dev Fund
as a Restricted Fund donation under the above constraints (suitably formalized),
and keep separate accounting of its balance and usage under its Transparency and
Accountability obligations defined below.

ZCG SHALL strive to define target metrics and key performance indicators,
and the ZCG Committee SHOULD utilize these in its funding decisions.

Furthering Decentralization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FPF SHALL conduct periodic reviews of the organizational structure, performance,
and effectiveness of the ZCG program and committee, taking into consideration
the input and recommendations of the ZCG Committee. As part of these periodic
reviews, FPF MUST commit to exploring the possibility of transitioning ZCG into
an independent organization if it is economically viable and it aligns with the
interests of the Zcash ecosystem and prevailing community sentiment.

In any transition toward independence, priority SHALL be given to maintaining or
enhancing the decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem. The newly formed
independent organization MUST ensure that decision-making processes remain
community-driven, transparent, and responsive to the evolving needs of the Zcash
community and ecosystem. In order to promote geographic decentralization, the
new organization SHOULD keep its domicile outside of the United States.

Transparency and Accountability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FPF MUST accept the following obligations in this section on behalf of ZCG:

* Publication of a ZCG Dashboard, providing a snapshot of ZCG’s current
  financials and any disbursements made to grantees.
* Bi-weekly meeting minutes documenting the decisions made by the ZCG committee
  on grants.
* Quarterly reports, detailing future plans, execution on previous plans, and
  finances (balances, and spending broken down by major categories).
* Annual detailed review of the organization performance and future plans.
* Annual financial report (IRS Form 990, or substantially similar information).

BP, ECC, ZF, FPF, ZCG and grant recipients MUST promptly disclose any security
or privacy risks that may affect users of Zcash (by responsible disclosure
under confidence to the pertinent developers, where applicable).

All substantial software whose development was funded by the Dev Fund SHOULD be
released under an Open Source license (as defined by the Open Source Initiative
[#osd]_), preferably the MIT license.

Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~~

FPF MUST contractually commit to fulfill these obligations on behalf of
ZCG, and the prescribed use of funds, such that substantial violation, not
promptly remedied, will result in a modified version of Zcash node software
that removes ZCG’s Dev Fund slice and allocates it to the Deferred Dev Fund
lockbox.

Funding Streams
---------------

* 12% of the block subsidy is to be distributed to the lockbox.
* 8% of the block subsidy is to be distributed to the Financial Privacy
  Foundation (FPF), for the express use of the Zcash Community Grants Committee
  (ZCG) to fund independent teams in the Zcash ecosystem.

As of the activation of this ZIP, the complete set of funding streams for
Mainnet will be:

================= =========== ============= ============== ============
      Stream       Numerator   Denominator   Start height   End height

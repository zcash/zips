Terminology
===========

The key word "MUST" in this document is to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
[#BCP14]_ when, and only when, it appears in all capitals.

The term "network upgrade" in this document is to be interpreted as described in
ZIP 200. [#zip-0200]_

The terms "Testnet" and "Mainnet" are to be interpreted as described in section
3.12 of the Zcash Protocol Specification. [#protocol-networks]_

The character § is used when referring to sections of the Zcash Protocol Specification
[#protocol]_.


Abstract
========

In the current Zcash protocol, the miner of a coinbase transaction is permitted to
claim up to and including the total amount of miner subsidy plus fees from other
transactions in the block, but is not required to claim the full amount.

This proposal would require the full amount of miner subsidy and fees to be
collected in coinbase transactions.


Motivation
==========

The current semantics of coinbase transactions creates a potential for miners to
miscalculate the total amount of miner subsidy plus fees in a block. If they claim
a higher amount than the actual miner subsidy plus total fees, the block will be
invalid, but if they claim a lower amount, the excess is effectively burnt. As a
consequence, the effective ZEC issuance can fall short of the amount calculated
from the intended issuance curve.

This unnecessarily complicates the question of how much ZEC has been issued: if it
is defined as not including the amounts that were left unclaimed by miners, then it
is difficult to calculate, and cannot be predicted exactly in advance for any given
block height. Alternatively if it is defined to include those amounts, then that
introduces potentially confusing discrepancies between different definitions of
issuance or total supply.


Requirements
============

The consensus rule change specified in this ZIP must:

* allow issuance to be predicted exactly in advance, starting from the point at
  which it activates;
* preclude errors by miners in computing the total miner subsidy plus fees for
  transactions in the mined block;
* be deployable in the NU6 network upgrade, which is not expected to define a new
  transaction version.


Non-requirements
================

Since this ZIP is intended to activate in a network upgrade that is not expected
to support a new transaction version, it cannot resolve the issue that the amounts
of fees are implicit in non-coinbase transactions. That issue results in various
potential security difficulties and the potential for users' wallets to inadvertently
overpay the fee, but solving that would require an explicit "fee" field.

(It would technically be possible to encode the fee as a transparent output, but
that would be a more disruptive change than is desirable, since other consensus
rules would have to change in order to prevent this output from being spent, and
since existing consumers of the transaction format could misinterpret such outputs.)

This consensus change is not intended to prevent other methods of provably removing
ZEC from the circulating supply, such as sending it to an address for which it
would be demonstrably infeasible to find the spending key.


Specification
=============

From the activation block of this ZIP onward, coinbase transactions MUST claim all
of the available miner subsidy plus fees in their block.

Changes to the Zcash Protocol Specification
-------------------------------------------

The following sentence in § 3.4 ‘Transactions and Treestates’ [#protocol-transactions]_:

  The remaining value in the transparent transaction value pool of a coinbase
  transaction is destroyed.

is clarified as follows:

  The remaining value in the transparent transaction value pool of coinbase transactions
  in blocks prior to NU6 is destroyed. From activation of NU6, this remaining value
  is required to be zero; that is, all of the available balance MUST be consumed by
  outputs of the coinbase transaction.

In § 7.1.2 ‘Transaction Consensus Rules’ [#protocol-txnconsensus]_ as modified by
[#zip-2001]_, replace:

  The total output value of a coinbase transaction MUST NOT be greater than its
  total input value.

with

  [Pre-NU6] The total output value of a coinbase transaction MUST NOT be greater
  than its total input value.

  [NU6 onward] The total output value of a coinbase transaction MUST be equal to
  its total input value.

These changes apply identically to Mainnet and Testnet.


Deployment
==========

This ZIP is to be deployed with NU6. [#zip-0253]_

The wording change to § 7.1.2 depends on [#zip-2001]_ which is also to be deployed
with NU6. [#zip-0253]_

# Terminology

The key word "MUST" in this document is to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [^BCP14] when, and only when, it appears in all capitals.

The term "network upgrade" in this document is to be interpreted as described
in ZIP 200. [^zip-0200]

The character § is used when referring to sections of the Zcash Protocol
Specification. [^protocol]

The terms "Mainnet" and "Testnet" are to be interpreted as described in
§ 3.12 ‘Mainnet and Testnet’. [^protocol-networks]

The symbol "$\,\cdot\,$" means multiplication, as described in § 2 ‘Notation’.
[^protocol-notation]

"ZEC/TAZ" refers to the native currency of Zcash on a given network, i.e.
ZEC on Mainnet and TAZ on Testnet.

The terms "Block Subsidy" and "Issuance" are to be interpreted as described in
ZIP 233. [^zip-0233]


# Abstract

This ZIP proposes to remove 60% of transaction fees from circulation, while
the remaining 40% is directed as before, providing a deflationary effect, and
building the groundwork for long-term support of the Zcash network via the new
block subsidy rules proposed by ZIP 234 [^zip-0234].


# Motivation

ZIP 233 ("Network Sustainability Mechanism: Removing Funds From Circulation"
[^zip-0233]) describes a method by which ZEC can be removed from circulation to
support network sustainability.

By introducing a requirement that a certain proportion of transaction fees be
removed from circulation, we aim to contribute to the long-term sustainability
of the network as described below:

## Benefits to the Network

1. **Network Sustainability**: This mechanism involves temporarily reducing the
   supply of ZEC, similar to asset burning in Ethereum’s EIP-1559 [^eip-1559],
   but with long-term sustainability benefits, as the funds removed from
   circulation effectively boost future mining rewards, making it an attractive
   option for current and future Zcash users.
2. **Incentivizing Transaction Inclusion**: By maintaining a 40% share of
   transaction fees for miners, we continue incentivizing miners to prioritize
   including transactions in their blocks. This helps ensure the continued
   efficient processing of transactions and supports a robust and responsive
   network.
3. **Aligning Interests:** Removing transaction fees from circulation aligns the
   interests of miners with the long-term health of the network, incentivizing
   them to prioritize security and efficiency. As miners focus on maintaining a
   robust network, overall adoption and usage can increase, leading to higher
   transaction volumes in the long run. This structure discourages short-term
   profit-seeking behaviors, as miners benefit more from a stable and thriving
   ecosystem than from engaging in malicious activities that could undermine the
   network's reputation and security.
4. **Future-Proofing the Network**: Removing a portion of transaction fees from
   circulation is a forward-looking approach that prepares the Zcash network for
   future challenges and opportunities. It establishes a financial buffer that
   can be instrumental in addressing unforeseen issues and seizing strategic
   advantages as the Zcash ecosystem evolves.


# Requirements

* For each block, at least 60% (rounded down) of the total fees are to be
  removed from circulation.
* No restrictions are placed on the destination of the remaining proportion of
  fees.
* Any fractions are rounded in favor of the miner.


# Specification

## Consensus Rule Changes

For a given block, the coinbase transaction MUST have a $\mathsf{zip233\_amount}$,
as defined in [^zip-0233], that is greater than or equal to
$\mathsf{floor}(\mathsf{transactionFees} \cdot 6 / 10)$.

The version of a coinbase transaction MUST be v6 or later [^zip-0230].

## Applicability

All of these changes apply identically to Mainnet and Testnet.


# Rationale

We believe the proposed changes to be relatively low-impact in terms of
implementation and protocol changes. Additionally, transaction fees are
currently small enough that the reduction in miner fees is unlikely to be a
concern.

## Rationale for requiring the coinbase transaction to be v6 or later

There is no explicit mechanism in prior transaction versions to remove
the required funds from circulation. Since $\mathsf{zip233\_amount} = 0$
for transaction versions prior to v6, absent the rule about the coinbase
transaction version it would be technically possible to satisfy the constraint
on $\mathsf{zip233\_amount}$ with earlier versions than v6, but only when
$\mathsf{transactionFees} = 0$. That would introduce a corner case in the
transaction consensus rules that is not useful, since it is expected that the
$\mathsf{transactionFees}$ will normally be non-zero.

## Estimated impact on miners

Over 100,000 blocks starting at block 2235515, there were 316130 transactions.
60608 of them are categorized as 'sandblasting' transactions. The remaining
transactions have an average of 5.46 logical actions (see ZIP 317 [^zip-0317]).

The total fees paid to miners from those transactions, assuming the ZIP 317
regime, would be 87.86 ZEC. 100,000 blocks is approximately 3 months of blocks.
Extrapolating to a year, we would expect 351.44 ZEC in fees paid to miners over
a year.

If 60% of these fees are removed from circulation, that would be 210.864 ZEC per
year. [^zsf-fee-estimator]

## Considerations for the Future

If transaction fees were to increase, further modifications can easily be
proposed to alter the 60%/40% split. Finding the optimal fee split may require
an iterative approach involving adjustments based on real-world data and network
dynamics.

Looking further into the future, there may come a time when the transaction fees
become greater than the block subsidy issuance. At that time we may need to
reconsider the 60/40 split. However, this will likely not be the case for the
next 8-10 years due to forecasts based on issuance models and network traffic.

Further ZIPs may be proposed to remove ZEC from circulation in various ways to
support network sustainability, including but not limited to:

- ZSA fees
- Fees and donations specific to decentralized applications
- “Storage fees” for any future data availability
- Cross-chain bridge usage / Cross-chain messaging
- Note sorting micro-transactional fees


# Deployment

The implementation of this ZIP MUST be deployed at the same time or after
ZIP 233 ("NSM: Removing Funds From Circulation" [^zip-0233]), and ZIP 234 ("NSM:
Issuance Smoothing" [^zip-0234]).

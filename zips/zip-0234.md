# Terminology

The key word "MUST" in this document is to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [^BCP14] when, and only when, it appears in all capitals.

The term "network upgrade" in this document is to be interpreted as described
in ZIP 200. [^zip-0200]

The character § is used when referring to sections of the Zcash Protocol
Specification. [^protocol]

The terms "Mainnet" and "Testnet" are to be interpreted as described in
§ 3.12 ‘Mainnet and Testnet’. [^protocol-networks]

The symbol "$\,\cdot\,$" means multiplication, as described in § 2 ‘Notation’.
[^protocol-notation]

"ZEC/TAZ" refers to the native currency of Zcash on a given network, i.e.
ZEC on Mainnet and TAZ on Testnet.

The terms "Block Subsidy" and "Issuance" are to be interpreted as described in
ZIP 233. [^zip-0233]

Let $\mathsf{PostBlossomHalvingInterval}$ be as defined in [^protocol-diffadjustment].

$\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY}$, as defined in § 5.3 ‘Constants’ [^protocol-constants],
is the total ZEC/TAZ supply cap measured in zatoshi, corresponding to
21,000,000 ZEC. This is slightly larger than the supply cap for the current
issuance mechanism, but is the value used in existing critical consensus
checks.

"Issued Supply" - The Issued Supply at a given height of a block chain is
the total ZEC/TAZ value in all chain value pool balances at that height, as
calculated by $\mathsf{IssuedSupply}(\mathsf{height})$ defined in
§ 4.17 ‘Chain Value Pool Balances’. [^protocol-chainvaluepoolbalances]

"Money Reserve" - The Money Reserve at a given height of a block chain is
the total ZEC/TAZ value remaining to be issued, as calculated by
$\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY} - \mathsf{IssuedSupply}(\mathsf{height})$.


# Abstract

This ZIP proposes a change to how nodes calculate the block subsidy.

Instead of following a step function around the 4-year halving intervals
inherited from Bitcoin, we propose a smooth logarithmic curve, defined as a
fixed portion of the current value of the Money Reserve at a given block height.

The new issuance scheme would approximate the current issuance over 4-year
intervals, assuming no ZEC/TAZ is removed from circulation during that time, and
retains the overall supply cap of `MAX_MONEY`.


# Motivation

Key Objectives:

1. We want to introduce an automated mechanism that allows users of the network
   to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the network.
2. We want to enable ZEC that has been removed from circulation to be reissued
   in the future to benefit network sustainability.
3. We want to retain the existing ZEC supply cap of 21 million.
4. We want the issuance rate to remain similar to the historical rate for Zcash
   (and before that, Bitcoin).
5. We want issuance to be easy for all network users to understand and predict.
6. We want the new issuance to activate at a block with as minimal a delta from
   the current issuance as possible.

The current Zcash economic model, inherited from Bitcoin, includes a halving
mechanism that dictates the issuance of new coins. While this has been
foundational, halvings can lead to abrupt changes in the rate of new coins
being introduced to the market. Such sudden shifts can potentially disrupt the
network's economic model, potentially impacting its security and stability.
Furthermore, the halvings schedule is fixed and does not provide any way to
"recycle" funds into future issuance.

This new NSM-based issuance scheme solves these problems by ensuring a more
consistent and predictable rate of coin issuance, while preserving the core
aspects of Zcash's issuance policy and the 21-million-coin cap. At the same
time, it introduces the first mechanism to recreate and distribute ZEC that has
been removed from circulation, as well as unclaimed transaction fees, across
future block subsidies.

# Requirements

Smoothing the issuance curve is possible using an exponential decay formula
that satisfies the following requirements:

1. The issuance can be summarized into a reasonably simple explanation.
2. Block subsidies approximate a continuous function.
3. If the Money Reserve is greater than 0, then the block subsidy must be
   non-zero, preventing any final "unmined" zatoshis.
4. For any 4-year period, all paid out block subsidies are approximately equal
   to half of the Money Reserve at the beginning of that 4-year period, if no
   ZEC is removed from circulation during those 4 years.
5. Decrease the short-term impact of the deployment of this ZIP on block subsidy
   recipients, and minimize the potential reputation risk to Zcash of changing
   the block subsidy amount.
6. The immediate change in issuance when this mechanism activates should be
   minimal.

# Specification

## Parameters

$\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION} = 4126 / 10\_000\_000\_000 = 0.0000004126$

$\mathsf{DEPLOYMENT\_BLOCK\_HEIGHT} = \mathsf{TBD}$

$\mathsf{MoneyReserveAfter}(\mathsf{height}) =$ The value of the Money Reserve
after the specified block height.

The block height will be chosen by the following criteria:

- It is after NU7 activation height.
- It is calculated to be the lowest height after the second halving at which
  the NSM issuance would be less than the current BTC-style issuance _neglecting_
  any ZEC removed from circulation (i.e. assuming the amount of ZEC removed from
  circulation is exactly 0).

## Issuance Calculation

At the $\mathsf{DEPLOYMENT\_BLOCK\_HEIGHT}$, nodes should switch from the current issuance
calculation, to the following:

$\mathsf{BlockSubsidy}(\mathsf{height}) = \mathsf{ceiling}(\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION} \cdot \mathsf{MoneyReserveAfter}(\mathsf{height} - 1))$

## Applicability

All of these changes apply identically to Mainnet and Testnet.


# Rationale

* Using an exponential decay function satisfies **Requirements 1** and **2** above.
* We round up to the next zatoshi to satisfy **Requirement 3** above.

## Parameters

The selection is intended to achieve Key Objective 6 while still being at
a constant, predictable height. An alternative would be to have a dynamic
"latch"-style activation, which would calculate the activation height by
testing the "less than" conditional with every block after the second halving.
We prefer the pre-defined constant height parameter, to give everyone more
_time_ certainty at the cost of _issuance level_ certainty.

The difference in up-front calculation versus dynamic calculation is
in whether or not funds removed from circulation are accounted for
(since funds removed from circulation in the future cannot be calculated
up-front). This means with the pre-defined constant parameter approach,
issuance will jump _up_ some amount at activation. This amount should be
equivalent to all ZEC removed from circulation prior to that height times
$\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION}$. For example, if a total of 100,000 ZEC were
burnt prior to the pre-defined constant activation height, then at activation
the issuance would be larger than BTC-style issuance by $100\_000\textsf{ ZEC}
\cdot \mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION}$, which we calculate equals $0.04126$
ZEC. This example is chosen to demonstrate that a very large amount removed from
circulation (much larger than expected) would elevate issuance by a relatively
small amount. For this reason, we believe a pre-defined constant is a better
approach to achieving Key Objective 6 than a "dynamic latch" logic because it is
so much simpler to implement and reason about.

## BLOCK_SUBSIDY_FRACTION

Let $\mathsf{IntendedMoneyReserveFractionRemainingAfterFourYears} = 0.5$.

The value $4126 / 10\_000\_000\_000$ satisfies the approximation within $\pm 0.002\%$:

$(1 - \mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION})^\mathsf{PostBlossomHalvingInterval} \approx \mathsf{IntendedMoneyReserveFractionRemainingAfterFourYears}$

This implies that after a period of 4 years around half of Money Reserve will
have been issued as block subsidies, thus satisfying **Requirement 4**.

The largest possible value in the Money Reserve is $\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY}$, in the
theoretically possible case that all issued funds are removed from circulation.
If this happened, the largest interim sum in the block subsidy calculation would
be $\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY} \cdot 4126 / 10\_000\_000\_000$.

This uses 62.91 bits, which is just under the 63-bit limit for signed
two's complement 64-bit integer amount types.

The numerator could be brought closer to the limit by using a larger
denominator, but the difference in the amount issued would be very small. So we
chose a power-of-10 denominator for simplicity.

TODO for ZIP owners: How many ZEC per day?

## Visualization of the Smoothed Curve

The following graph compares issuance for the current halving-based step
function vs the smoothed curve.

# Appendix: Simulation

The [NSM Simulator](https://github.com/eigerco/zsf-simulator) allows us to
simulate the effects of this ZIP on the Money Reserve and the block subsidy, as
well as generate plots like the ones above. Its output:

```
Last block is 47917869 in ~113.88 years
```

indicates that, assuming that no ZEC is ever removed from circulation, the Money
Reserve will be depleted after 113.88 years, and the block subsidy will be 0 ZEC
after that point.

This fragment of the output:

```
Halving  1 at block  1680000:
  NSM subsidies:    262523884819889 (~ 2625238.848 ZEC,        1.563 ZEC per block)
  legacy subsidies: 262500000000000 (~ 2625000.000 ZEC,        1.562 ZEC per block)
  difference:           23884819889 (~         238 ZEC),         NSM/legacy: 1.0001
```

shows that the difference between the smoothed out and the current issuance
schemes is 238 ZEC after 1680000 blocks (around 4 years).


# Appendix: Considerations for the Future

Future protocol changes may not increase the payout rate to a reasonable
approximation beyond the four year half-life constraint.


# Deployment

This ZIP is proposed to activate with Network Upgrade 7. [^zip-0254]
It MUST be deployed at the same time or after ZIP 233 ("NSM: Removing Funds From
Circulation" [^zip-0233]).

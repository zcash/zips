Terminology
===========

The key word "MUST" in this document is to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [#BCP14]_
when, and only when, it appears in all capitals.

The character § is used when referring to sections of the Zcash Protocol Specification
[#protocol]_.


Abstract
========

This proposal adds an explicit ``fee`` field to the v6 transaction format.
Instead of fees being implicit in the difference between the input value and
output value of the transaction, all value transfers, including fee transfers to
miners, will be explicit and committed to via the txid.


Motivation
==========

When it comes to fee selection, it should be very hard to make mistakes.
The current transparent fee computation (inherited from Bitcoin) — input value
less output value — is prone to user error. It is very easy to forget to add an
output for a change address, make a calculation error [#bitcointalk-fee-error]_,
mix up units etc.

In addition, when signing a transaction with a hardware wallet, using an implicit 
fee means that the hardware wallet must recompute the fee on its own and cannot
simply display the value being committed to.

Finally, this change will make it possible for light clients to determine the
fee paid by a transaction without needing to download and inspect transparent
inputs to the transaction.


Requirements
============

There must not be any potentially error-prone calculations needed to compute the
fee for a given transaction. That is, the fee must be obvious from the encoding
of the transaction.


Specification
=============

Transaction Format
------------------

The following field is added to the v6 transaction format [#zip-0230-transaction-format]_.

+-------+---------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Bytes | Name    | Data Type  | Description                                          |
+=======+=========+============+======================================================+
|   8   | ``fee`` | ``uint64`` | The fee to be paid by this transaction, in zatoshis. |
+-------+---------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+

Consensus Rules
---------------

The following changes are to be made to the Zcash Protocol Specification [#protocol]_.

In § 3.4 ‘Transactions and Treestates’ [#protocol-transactions]_ (last modified by
ZIP 236 [#zip-0236]_), add the following consensus rule and note:

  * [NU7 onward] For v6 and later transactions, the remaining value in the
    transparent transaction value pool, in zatoshis, MUST be equal to the value
    of the transaction’s ``fee`` field.
 
  Non-normative note: The effect of these rules is that the ``fee`` field of
  v6 and later coinbase transactions will always be zero.

In § 7.1 ‘Transaction Encoding and Consensus’ [#protocol-txnconsensus]_, add:

  [NU7 onward] ``fee`` MUST be in the range :math:`\{ 0 .. \mathsf{MAX\_MONEY} \}`.

Signature Hash
--------------

The transaction signature hashing algorithm defined in ZIP 244 is to be modified
for v6 transactions as follows:

Section T.1: `header_digest` [#zip-0244-header-digest]_ is specified in
`draft-txv6-sighash` [#draft-txv6-sighash]_ to read:

  A BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values ::
  
     T.1a: version             (4-byte little-endian version identifier including ``fOverwintered`` flag)
     T.1b: version_group_id    (4-byte little-endian version group identifier)
     T.1c: consensus_branch_id (4-byte little-endian consensus branch id)
     T.1d: lock_time           (4-byte little-endian ``nLockTime`` value)
     T.1e: expiry_height       (4-byte little-endian block height)
     T.1f: fee                 (8-byte little-endian fee value)
  
  The personalization field of this hash is set to::
  
    "ZTxIdHeadersHash"


Reference implementation
========================

TBD

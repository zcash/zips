Terminology
===========

The key word "MUST" in this document is to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
[#BCP14]_ when, and only when, it appears in all capitals.

The term "network upgrade" in this document is to be interpreted as described in
ZIP 200. [#zip-0200]_

The character § is used when referring to sections of the Zcash Protocol
Specification. [#protocol]_

The terms "Mainnet" and "Testnet" are to be interpreted as described in
§ 3.12 ‘Mainnet and Testnet’. [#protocol-networks]_


Abstract
========

This proposal adds an explicit ``fee`` field to the v6 transaction format.
Instead of fees being implicit in the difference between the input value and
output value of the transaction, all value transfers, including fee transfers to
miners, will be explicit and committed to via the txid.


Motivation
==========

When it comes to fee selection, it should be very hard to make mistakes.
The current transparent fee computation (inherited from Bitcoin) — input value
less output value — is prone to user error. It is very easy to forget to add an
output for a change address, make a calculation error [#bitcointalk-fee-error]_,
mix up units etc.

In addition, when signing a transaction with a hardware wallet, using an implicit 
fee means that the hardware wallet must recompute the fee on its own and cannot
simply display the value being committed to.

Finally, this change will make it possible for light clients to determine the
fee paid by a transaction without needing to download and inspect transparent
inputs to the transaction.


Requirements
============

Parties that see a transaction, even in isolation, reliably know its fee.
That is, the fee must be explicit in the encoding of the transaction,
and no potentially error-prone calculations or additional chain data are 
needed to compute it.


Specification
=============

Changes to ZIP 230 [#zip-0230]_
-------------------------------

The following field is appended to the Common Transaction Fields of the v6
transaction format after  ``nExpiryHeight`` [#zip-0230-transaction-format]_:

+-------+---------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Bytes | Name    | Data Type  | Description                                          |
+=======+=========+============+======================================================+
|   8   | ``fee`` | ``uint64`` | The fee to be paid by this transaction, in zatoshis. |
+-------+---------+------------+------------------------------------------------------+

Note: If both this ZIP and ZIP 233 are selected for inclusion in the same
Network Upgrade, then the ambiguity in ordering of the fields added by these
ZIPs would need to be resolved.

Changes to the Zcash Protocol Specification
-------------------------------------------

In § 3.4 ‘Transactions and Treestates’ [#protocol-transactions]_ (last modified by
ZIP 236 [#zip-0236]_), add the following consensus rule and note:

  * [NU7 onward] For v6 and later transactions, the remaining value in the
    transparent transaction value pool, in zatoshis, MUST be equal to the value
    of the transaction’s ``fee`` field.
 
  Non-normative note: The effect of these rules is that the ``fee`` field of
  v6 and later coinbase transactions will always be zero.

In § 7.1 ‘Transaction Encoding and Consensus’ [#protocol-txnconsensus]_, add:

  [NU7 onward] ``fee`` MUST be in the range $\{ 0 .. \mathsf{MAX\_MONEY} \}$.


Modifications relative to ZIP 244 [#zip-0244]_
----------------------------------------------

Relative to the sighash algorithm defined in ZIP 244, the sighash algorithm
that applies to v6 transactions differs by appending the ``fee`` field to
the Common Transaction Fields that are the input to the digest in
T.1: header_digest [#zip-0244-header-digest]_::

   T.1f: fee (8-byte little-endian fee amount)

Note: If both this ZIP and ZIP 233 are selected for inclusion in the same
Network Upgrade, then the ambiguity in ordering of the fields added by these
ZIPs would need to be resolved.


Applicability
-------------

All of these changes apply identically to Mainnet and Testnet.


Deployment
==========

This ZIP is proposed to be deployed with the next transaction version change,
which is assumed to be v6. [#zip-0230]_


Reference implementation
========================

TBD

Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "REQUIRED", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [#BCP14]_ when, and
only when, they appear in all capitals.

The terms "Testnet" and "Mainnet" are to be interpreted as described in
section 3.11 of the Zcash Protocol Specification [#protocol-networks]_.

The terms below are to be interpreted as follows:

payment
  A transfer of funds implemented by a shielded or transparent output of a Zcash
  transaction.

payment request
  A request for a wallet to construct a single Zcash transaction containing one or 
  more payments.

Abstract
========

This ZIP proposes a standard format for payment request URIs. Wallets that
recognize this format enable users to construct transactions simply by
clicking links on webpages or scanning QR codes.


Motivation
==========

In order for a robust transactional ecosystem to evolve for Zcash, it is
necessary for vendors to be able to issue requests for payment. At present, the
best option available is to manually specify a payment address, a payment
amount, and potentially memo field content. Of these three components, existing
wallets only provide functionality for reading payment addresses in a
semi-automated fashion. It is then necessary for the user to manually enter
payment amounts and any associated memo information, which is tedious and may
be error-prone, particularly if a payment is intended for multiple recipients
or the memo field information contains structured data that must be faithfully
reproduced.

This ZIP seeks to eliminate these issues by proposing a standard format that
wallet vendors may support so that human intervention is required only for
approval, not creation, of such a transaction.

In Bitcoin, two different standards exist to permit vendors to issue payment
requests that are understood by wallets: BIP 21 [#bip-0021]_ and BIP 70
[#bip-0070]_. BIP 21 provides a URI format that can be interpreted by a wallet
to construct simple, single-recipient transactions; BIP 70 uses a protobuf-based
protocol that permits requests for transactions of arbitrary complexity.

The format proposed in this ZIP seeks a middle ground between these approaches:
to provide a URI-based format which supports both the trivial use case and
the slightly-more-complex situation where a transaction may include payments to
multiple recipients.


Requirements
============

The format must be a valid URI format [#RFC3986]_.

The format must permit the representation of one or more (payment address, amount,
memo) tuples.


Specification
=============

URI Syntax
----------

The following syntax specification uses ABNF [#RFC5234]_.

.. code-block:: EBNF

  zcashurn        = "zcash:" ( zcashaddress [ "?" zcashparams ] / "?" zcashparams )
  zcashaddress    = 1*( ALPHA / DIGIT )
  zcashparams     = zcashparam [ "&" zcashparams ]
  zcashparam      = [ addrparam / amountparam / memoparam / messageparam / labelparam / reqparam / otherparam ]
  NONZERO         = %x31-39
  DIGIT           = %x30-39
  paramindex      = "." NONZERO 0*3DIGIT
  addrparam       = "address" [ paramindex ] "=" zcashaddress
  amountparam     = "amount"  [ paramindex ] "=" 1*DIGIT [ "." 1*8DIGIT ]
  labelparam      = "label"   [ paramindex ] "=" *qchar
  memoparam       = "memo"    [ paramindex ] "=" *base64url
  messageparam    = "message" [ paramindex ] "=" *qchar
  paramname       = ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" )
  reqparam        = "req-" paramname [ paramindex ] [ "=" *qchar ]
  otherparam      = paramname [ paramindex ] [ "=" *qchar ]
  qchar           = unreserved / pct-encoded / allowed-delims / ":" / "@"
  allowed-delims  = "!" / "$" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";"

Here, ``ALPHA``, ``unreserved`` and ``pct-encoded`` are as defined in
[#RFC3986]_. "base64url" is defined as in [#base64url]_ with padding omitted.
(Note that this uses a different alphabet to the usual base64; the values 62 and
63 in the alphabet are encoded as ``-`` and ``_`` respectively. Implementations
MUST NOT accept the characters ``+``, ``/``, and ``=`` that occur only in the
usual base64.)

Productions of the form ``1*x`` indicate one or more successive instances of the
production ``x``. Productions of the form ``<n>*<m>x`` indicate at least `<n>` and
at most `<m>` instances of production ``x``.

Note that this grammar does not allow percent encoding outside the productions
that use ``qchar``, i.e. the values of label, message, ``reqparam``, and
``otherparam`` parameters.

Purported ZIP 321 URIs that cannot be parsed according to the above grammar
MUST NOT be accepted.


URI Semantics
-------------

A ZIP-321 URI represents a request for the construction of a transaction having
one or more *payments*. In the case that only a single payment is being
requested, the recipient address SHOULD be included in the ``hier-part`` component
of the RFC 3986 URI; otherwise, multiple recipient addresses can be specified
using ``addrparam`` parameters with different indices.

Addresses, amounts, labels, and messages sharing the same ``paramindex``
(including the empty ``paramindex``) are interpreted to be associated with
the same payment for the purposes of payment construction. A ``paramindex``
MUST NOT have leading zero(s).  There is no significance to the ordering of
parameters, and ``paramindex`` values need not be sequential.

Implementations SHOULD construct a single transaction that pays all of the
specified instances of ``zcashaddress``. The number of such addresses is
therefore limited by restrictions on transaction construction. In general this
limit depends, at least, on the mix of destination address types. For example,
if all payments were to Sapling payment addresses (each specified either
directly or as a Receiver of a Unified Address), the limit described in
[#protocol-saplingbalance]_ implies that constructing a transaction for a
ZIP-321 URI might fail if it requests more than 2109 distinct payments. The
effective limit might be lower if payments to Orchard addresses or other future
types of address are included.

A URI of the form ``zcash:<address>?...`` MUST be considered equivalent to a
URI of the form ``zcash:?address=<address>&...`` where ``<address>`` is an
instance of ``zcashaddress``.

If there are any non-address parameters having a given ``paramindex``, then
the URI MUST contain an address parameter having that ``paramindex``. There
MUST NOT be more than one occurrence of a given parameter and ``paramindex``.

Implementations SHOULD check that each instance of ``zcashaddress`` is a valid
string encoding of an address, other than a Sprout address, as specified in the
subsections of section 5.6 (Encoding of Addresses and Keys) of the Zcash protocol
specification [#protocol-addressandkeyencoding]_. At the time of writing this
includes the following address formats:

* a Zcash transparent address, as defined in [#protocol-transparentaddrencoding]_,
  using Base58Check [#base58check]_;
* a Zcash Sapling payment address as defined in [#protocol-saplingpaymentaddrencoding]_,
  using Bech32 [#zip-0173]_;
* a Zcash Unified Address as defined in [#protocol-unifiedencodings]_ and [#zip-0316]_,
  using Bech32m [#bip-0350]_.

New address formats may be added to [#protocol-addressandkeyencoding]_ in future,
and these SHOULD be supported whether or not this ZIP is updated to explicitly
include them.

If the context of whether the payment URI is intended for Testnet or Mainnet is
available, then each address SHOULD be checked to be for the correct network.

All of the requirements of ZIP 316 [#zip-0316]_ apply in the case of payments
to Unified Addresses.

Sprout addresses MUST NOT be supported in payment requests. The rationale for
this is that transfers to Sprout addresses are, since activation of the Canopy
network upgrade, restricted by ZIP 211 [#zip-0211]_. It cannot generally be
expected that senders will have funds available in the Sprout pool with which
to satisfy requests for payment to a Sprout address. If the same rationale
applies to other address types in future, consideration should be given to
updating this ZIP to exclude these types, as part of their deprecation.

Transfer amount
---------------

If an amount is provided, it MUST be specified in decimal ZEC. If a decimal fraction
is present then a period (`.`) MUST be used as the separating character to separate
the whole number from the decimal fraction, and both the whole number and the 
decimal fraction MUST be nonempty. No other separators (such as commas for 
grouping or thousands) are permitted. Leading zeros in the whole number or trailing
zeros in the decimal fraction are ignored. There MUST NOT be more than 8 digits in 
the decimal fraction.

For example,
 * ``amount=50.00`` or ``amount=50`` or ``amount=050`` is treated as 50 ZEC;
 * ``amount=0.5`` or ``amount=00.500`` is treated as 0.5 ZEC; and
 * ``amount=50,000.00`` or ``amount=50,00`` or ``amount=50.`` or ``amount=.5``
   or ``amount=0.123456789`` are invalid.

The amount MUST NOT be greater than 21000000 ZEC (in general, monetary amounts
in Zcash cannot be greater than this value).

Query Keys
----------

label
   Label for an address (e.g. name of receiver). If a label is present at
   a ``paramindex``, a client rendering a payment for inspection by the user
   SHOULD display this label (if possible) as well as the associated address.
   If the label is displayed, it MUST be identifiable as distinct from the address.

address
   Zcash address string (shielded or transparent)

memo
   Contents for the Zcash shielded memo field, encoded as base64url without
   ``=`` padding. The decoded memo contents MUST NOT exceed 512 bytes, and
   if shorter, will be filled with trailing zeros to 512 bytes.
   Parsers MUST consider the entire URI invalid if the address associated with
   the same ``paramindex`` does not permit the use of memos (i.e. it is a
   transparent address).

message
   Message that clients can display for the purpose of presenting descriptive
   information about the payment at the associated ``paramindex`` to the user.

::

  zcash:?address=tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU&amount=123.456&address.1=ztestsapling10yy2ex5dcqkclhc7z7yrnjq2z6feyjad56ptwlfgmy77dmaqqrl9gyhprdx59qgmsnyfska2kez&amount.1=0.789&memo.1=VGhpcyBpcyBhIHVuaWNvZGUgbWVtbyDinKjwn6aE8J-PhvCfjok

A valid payment request with one transparent and one shielded Sapling recipient
address, with a base64url-encoded Unicode memo for the shielded recipient.

Invalid Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  zcash:?amount=3491405.05201255&address.1=ztestsapling10yy2ex5dcqkclhc7z7yrnjq2z6feyjad56ptwlfgmy77dmaqqrl9gyhprdx59qgmsnyfska2kez&amount.1=5740296.87793245

An invalid payment request; this is missing a payment address with empty ``paramindex``.

::

  zcash:?address=tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU&amount=1&amount.1=2&address.2=ztestsapling10yy2ex5dcqkclhc7z7yrnjq2z6feyjad56ptwlfgmy77dmaqqrl9gyhprdx59qgmsnyfska2kez

Also invalid; this request is missing ``address.1=``.

::

  zcash:?address.0=ztestsapling10yy2ex5dcqkclhc7z7yrnjq2z6feyjad56ptwlfgmy77dmaqqrl9gyhprdx59qgmsnyfska2kez&amount.0=2

Also invalid; ``address.0=`` and ``amount.0=`` are not permitted as leading 0s are
forbidden in ``paramindex``.

::

  zcash:?amount=1.234&amount=2.345&address=tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU

  zcash:?amount.1=1.234&amount.1=2.345&address.1=tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU

Also invalid; duplicate ``amount=`` or ``amount.1=`` fields

::

  zcash:tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU?amount=1%30
  zcash:tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU?%61mount=1
  zcash:%74mEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU?amount=1

Invalid; percent encoding is only allowed in ``qchar`` productions, which do
not include addresses, amounts, or parameter names.

::

  zcash://tmEZhbWHTpdKMw5it8YDspUXSMGQyFwovpU?amount=1

Invalid; the grammar does not allow ``//``. ZIP 321 URIs are not
"hierarchical URIs" in the sense defined in [#RFC3986]_ section 1.2.3,
and do not have an "authority component".


Forward compatibility
---------------------

Variables which are prefixed with a ``req-`` are considered required. If a
parser does not recognize any variables which are prefixed with ``req-``, it
MUST consider the entire URI invalid. Any other variables that are not
recognized, but that are not prefixed with a ``req-``, SHOULD be ignored.

``req-`` is potentially part of a given parameter name that may be defined
in a future version of this ZIP, not a modifier that can be applied to an
arbitrary parameter. None of the originally defined parameters (``address``,
``amount``, ``label``, ``memo``, and ``message``) include the ``req-``
prefix, because these parameters are REQUIRED to be understood by all
conformant ZIP 321 URI parsers.

Backward compatibility
----------------------

As this ZIP is written, several clients already implement a ``zcash:`` URI
scheme similar to this one, however usually without the additional ``req-``
prefix requirement or the facility to specify multiple payments using
``paramindex``. These implementations also generally do not support URIs,
even with a single payment, where the address is specified as an ``address=``
query parameter rather than in the ``hier-part`` of the URI. They may also
not support the ``memo`` parameter, or may not treat it as base64url-encoded.

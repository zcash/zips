<h1 id="coin-voting">Coin Voting</h1>
<p>This ZIP describes a mechanism for the organization of coin-weighted
election.</p>
<h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>
<p>A person or organization, referred as the Election Board (EB) decides
to request the opinion of the zcash holders (ZH) on a particular topic.
The EB defines the parameters of the referendum: - when it starts
(snapshot height) and stops (closing height) - An optional lockdown
period before it closes - the question asked - the criteria for
aggregating the votes</p>
<p>They publically ask the ZH to participate by sending them ballots.
They verify and tally the votes following the aggregation method
(typicall linear, but it could be quadratic or something else). Then
they publish the outcome.</p>
<p>The final result of the election is a list of valid ballots that
have: - a value in ZEC - a message</p>
<p>The content of the message depends on the type of referendum. The
acceptable options should be defined by EB. For example, for a yes/no
question, it could simply be a value of 0 or 1.</p>
<p>The EB could decide to accept write-in votes too. The format of the
message is not part of this ZIP.</p>
<p>The value of the ballot MUST be an amount of ZEC that the ZH can
spend at the snapshot height.</p>
<p>The ZH is not obligated to vote with all the ZEC that they have. But
it MUST be impossible to use the same coins to vote twice on the same
election.</p>
<p>It MUST be possible to use the same ZEC on DIFFERENT elections.</p>
<p><strong>See Privacy section on important caveats regarding concurrent
voting.</strong></p>
<h2 id="other-uses-cases">Other Uses Cases</h2>
<h3 id="airdrop">Airdrop</h3>
<p>This ZIP can be used to perform air-drops. An organization that wants
to give their tokens/coins based on an amount of ZEC can organize an
election. The ballots contain the ZH’s address where they want to
receive the airdrop.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-balance">Proof of Balance</h3>
<p>In this case, the ZH sends an empty message because the ballot value
is all that matters.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="participants-actors">Participants / Actors</h2>
<h3 id="election-board">Election Board</h3>
<p>The Election Board (EB) is the entity in charge of organizing the
election (E). - The EB MUST have a website secured by https that clearly
reflects their identity. - They MUST make their announcements through
their website. - The EB SHOULD have a forum for election related
discussions - The EB MUST set the election parameters described in a
later section - The EB MUST publish the election parameters on their
website - The election parameters are immutable. If the EB wants to make
a modification, another election MUST be created</p>
<h3 id="voter-zh">Voter (ZH)</h3>
<p>Anyone who has <em>spending authority</em> of ZEC (either transparent
or shielded) can participate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ballots MUST have a ZEC value</li>
<li>Ballots MUST have a message in the format defined by the
Election</li>
<li>Ballots MUST include a proof of spending authority for the amount
specified, valid at the snapshot height</li>
<li>Ballots MUST not prevent the ZH from spending the coins in a
transaction</li>
<li>Coins spent before the snapshot height MUST not be eligible for
voting</li>
<li>Voting MUST not disclose information that would allow someone to use
the coins themselves (in a transaction or an election)</li>
<li>Ballots MUST follow the format specified in the section Ballot</li>
<li>ZEC held in transparent t3 addresses CANNOT be used. They introduce
most complexity and are not used much</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes: - Having coins on an exchange such as Binance, Bitfinex, etc.
does not allow you to vote because the coins are under their custody -
The EB MAY set special rules for the election. For example, there MAY be
a fee for casting a vote or a minimum ZEC requirement</p>
<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
<div class="danger">
<p>If the coins used for voting for a given election are not moved
before voting for another election, it is possible to link the
votes.</p>
</div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Transparent inputs are in clear</li>
<li>Shielded inputs reveal their nullifier</li>
</ol>
<p>The total value is also revealed since it is the weight of the
vote.</p>
<p>To mitigate this issue, the user SHOULD be offered to move their
coins after a vote. However, if multiple elections are carried out
concurrently with similar snapshot heights, it will be impossible for a
Voter to participate in both without linking their votes.</p>
<p>A possible solution is suggested in <a
href="https://hackmd.io/ujald5ElTMumppM7juk2WA?both">Air drops,
Proof-of-Balance, and Stake-weighted Polling</a></p>
<p>Alternatively, homomorphic encryption could be used in order to tally
the votes without decrypting them individually. However, this would be
less flexible than the above.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>The election E is carried in several sequential phases.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The EB publishes the E parameters and advertise the E</li>
<li>Each V prepares his/her ballot and send it to the EB</li>
<li>The EB returns a receipt to the V</li>
<li>The E enters a lockdown period</li>
<li>The E closes and the results are published</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ballots">Ballots</h2>
<p>The message part of a Ballot is encrypted with the V key. The
decryption key is sent to the EB after the lockdown period. The EB
validates the ballot coin value and returns a receipt. The Receipt
contains a signature from the EB.</p>
<h2 id="lockdown-period-ballot-list-commitment">Lockdown Period / Ballot
List commitment</h2>
<p>The lockdown period is optional but RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>It gives time for the Voters to check that their ballot is recorded
by the EB publicly and that no additional ballots are added after their
opening.</p>
<p>If a V does not see their ballot on the list, they MUST contact the
EB and resolve the dispute. Their receipt has the EB signature and
proves the integrity of the ballot. Failure to recognize a valid ballot
is a serious breach of trust.</p>
<h2 id="counting">Counting</h2>
<p>After the lockdown period, V MUST send their decryption key to the
EB.</p>
<p>EB decrypts the vote and updates the tally.</p>
<p>Finally EB publishes the results for everyone to see.</p>
<p>The encrypted ballots and their decryption keys are published for
verification.</p>
<h2 id="verification">Verification</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check that the ballot hashes correspond to the ballot published</li>
<li>For each ballot,</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Check the validity of the signatures and the zkps</li>
<li>Compute the coin value</li>
<li>Decrypt the vote</li>
<li>Tally the vote weighted by the coin value</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="specifications">Specifications</h1>
<p>The communication uses binary messages in protobuf format.</p>

<p>Only notes received and unspent between the start_height and the
snapshot height are eligible.</p>
<p>The start_height defaults to the Sapling activation height.</p>
<p>In addition, the EB MUST define a message in protobuf format. The
message MUST have a fixed size.</p>
<p><code>public</code> is defined in the section Message Encryption</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode proto"><code class="sourceCode protobuf"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">message</span> BallotContent {</span>

<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From the E definition, the E domain is calculated as</p>
<p><code>domain = Blake2b-256(b"Zcash_WCV_domain", E)</code></p>
<p>The E domain is included in the ballot and ensures that ballots
cannot be replayed.</p>

<h3 id="ballot-hash-sighash">Ballot Hash / Sighash</h3>
<p>For the signatures, the sighash is the blake2b-256 hash of the
serialization of the ballot data (in protobuf 3) with personalization
string <code>Zcash_WCV___Hash</code>.</p>
<p><code>hash = Blake2b-256("Zcash_WCVSigHash", BallotData)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="message-encryption">Message Encryption</h2>
<p>The EB MUST sign the ballot sighash with a ed25519 signing key and
return a receipt as a bech32m encoded signature with hrp
<code>pob-receipt-</code></p>
<p>The Voter MUST add a message in the format specified by the EB. The
message is encrypted into EncMessage. - epk is a 32 byte public key on
x25519 - the Voter reveals his own ed25519 signing key after the vote
closes - the EB converts the key to a x25519 secret key - the EB uses DH
to calculate a shared key KA - SymKey = Blake2b-256(KA,
perso=“Zcash_ProofBlnce”) - SymKey is used with Chacha20-Poly1305 to
decrypt the message - The tag MUST match the decrypted tag</p>
<p>Rationale: This design allows the use of ed25519 SSH keys for both
Voter and EB.</p>

- build reference data, i.e. cmx and nf Merkle trees; - copy their
wallet file <code>zec.db</code> from Ywallet. The vote does not have to
use this wallet app as long as it has the note data: - d, pkd, - v, -
rseed, - <span class="math inline"><em>ρ</em></span>, <span

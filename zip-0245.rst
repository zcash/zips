Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST" and "MUST NOT" in this document are to be interpreted as described
in BCP 14 [#BCP14]_ when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

The terms "consensus branch", "epoch", and "network upgrade" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in ZIP 200. [#zip-0200]_


Abstract
========

This proposal defines changes to ZIP 244 [#zip-0244]_ transaction id and signature digest 
algorithms to accommodate the inclusion of transparent Zcash extensions (TZEs) 
as defined in ZIP 222 [#zip-0222]_. 


Specification
=============

TxId Digest
-----------

The tree of hashes defined by ZIP 244 [#zip-0244]_ is re-structured to include a new
branch for TZE hashes. The ``tze_digest`` branch is the only new addition to the
tree; ``header_digest``, ``transparent_digest``, ``sprout_digest``, and ``sapling_digest``
are as in ZIP 244::

   txid_digest
   ├── header_digest
   ├── transparent_digest
   ├── tze_digest
   │   ├── tzein_digest
   │   └── tzeout_digest
   ├── sprout_digest
   └── sapling_digest

txid_digest
```````````
The top hash of the ``txid_digest`` tree is modified from the ZIP 244 structure
to be a BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values ::

   T.1: header_digest      (32-byte hash output)
   T.2: transparent_digest (32-byte hash output)
   T.3: tze_digest         (32-byte hash output)
   T.4: sprout_digest      (32-byte hash output)
   T.5: sapling_digest     (32-byte hash output)

The personalization field of this hash is unmodified from ZIP 244.
 
2: ``tze_digest``
'''''''''''''''''
A BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values ::

   T.2a: tzein_digest  (32-byte hash)
   T.2b: tzeout_digest (32-byte hash)

The personalization field of this hash is set to::

  "ZTxIdTZE____Hash" (4 underscore characters)

2a: tzein_digest
................
A BLAKE2b-256 hash of all TZE inputs to the transaction, excluding witness data.
For each TZE input, the following values are appended to this hash::

   2a.i:  extension_id (CompactSize field encoding)
   2a.ii: mode         (CompactSize field encoding)

The personalization field of this hash is set to::

  "ZTxIdTZEIns_Hash" (1 underscore character)

2a: tzeout_digest
.................
A BLAKE2b-256 hash of the field encoding of all TZE outputs 
belonging to the transaction.

The personalization field of this hash is set to::

  "ZTxIdTzeOutsHash"

Signature Digest
----------------

The signature digest creation algorithm defined by ZIP 244 [#zip-0244]_ is modified to
include a new branch for TZE hashes.  The ``tze_digest`` branch is the only new addition
to the tree; ``header_digest``, ``transparent_digest``, ``sprout_digest``, and
``sapling_digest`` are as in ZIP 244::

    signature_digest
    ├── header_digest
    ├── transparent_digest
    ├── tze_digest
    │   ├── tzein_digest
    │   └── tzeout_digest
    ├── sprout_digest
    └── sapling_digest

signature_digest
````````````````
A BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values ::

   S.1: header_digest      (32-byte hash output)
   S.2: transparent_digest (32-byte hash output)
   S.3: tze_digest         (32-byte hash output)
   S.4: sprout_digest      (32-byte hash output)
   S.5: sapling_digest     (32-byte hash output)

The personalization field of this hash is set to::

  "ZcashTxHash_" || CONSENSUS_BRANCH_ID

``ZcashTxHash_`` has 1 underscore character.

This value must have the same personalization as the top hash of the transaction
identifier digest tree, in order to make it possible to sign the transaction id
in the case that there are no transparent inputs.

S.3: tze_digest
'''''''''''''''
This digest is a BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values of the TZE
input being signed::

   S.3a: prevout_digest (field encoding bytes)
   S.3b: extension_id   (CompactSize field encoding)
   S.3c: mode           (CompactSize field encoding)
   S.3d: payload        (arbitrary bytes)
   S.3e: value          (8-byte little endian value of the output spent by this input) 

The personalization field of this hash is set to::

   "Zcash__TzeInHash" (2 underscore characters)

Authorizing Data Commitment
---------------------------

The tree of hashes defined by ZIP 244 [#zip-0244]_ for authorizing data commitments is
re-structured to include a new branch for TZE hashes. The ``tze_witnesses_digest`` branch
is the only new addition to the tree; ``transparent_auth_digest``, ``sprout_auth_digest``,
and ``sapling_auth_digest`` are as in ZIP 244::

   auth_digest
   ├── transparent_scripts_digest
   ├── tze_witnesses_digest
   ├── sprout_auth_digest
   └── sapling_auth_digest

auth_digest
```````````
The top hash of the ``auth_digest`` tree is modified from the ZIP 244 structure
to be a BLAKE2b-256 hash of the following values ::

   A.1: transparent_scripts_digest (32-byte hash output)
   A.2: tze_witnesses_digest       (32-byte hash output)
   A.3: sprout_auth_digest         (32-byte hash output)
   A.4: sapling_auth_digest        (32-byte hash output)

The personalization field of this hash is unmodified from ZIP 244.

2: tze_witnesses_digest
```````````````````````
A BLAKE2b-256 hash of the field encoding of the witness ``payload`` data associated
with each TZE input belonging to the transaction.

The personalization field of this hash is set to::

  "ZTxAuthTZE__Hash" (2 underscore characters)

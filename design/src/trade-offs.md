# Trade-Offs in Zcash Design

This chapter focuses on known deep trade-offs in protocol design facing Zcash. If there's a clear wide consensus, the Zcash developer community could consistently follow one side of a trade-off, in which case that can be documented here.

If there's not a clear consensus for a given trade-off, it's important to track how each feature or proposal impacts the trade-off explicitly to avoid an unintentional "design tug-of-war" around the trade-off.

Finally, many designs explicitly attempt to balance trade-offs, and it's important to track this as well to avoid disrupting the balancing mechanism.

For each trade-off chapter, we present the underlying trade-off, how the current Zcash design interacts with it, and what possibilities their may be for future protocol changes.

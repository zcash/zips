# Overview

This Zcash Design Guide complements the Zcash Protocol Specification and Zcash Improvement Proposals with higher-level considerations, such as the purpose of Zcash, fundamental design trade-offs, target use cases, and general operating beliefs which inform Zcash's design.

Some of the beliefs or value assertions in this guide are presumed to be held by a vast majority of Zcash dev collaborators, whereas others may be held by a minority of participants. It's important to document the latter case and clarify the position is not held by a clear majority so that this guide can map out diverse perspectives across the Zcash development community.

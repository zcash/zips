            <p>ZIP 226 and ZIP 227 propose in conjunction the Zcash Shielded Assets (ZSA) protocol, which is an extension of the Orchard protocol that enables the creation, transfer, and burn of custom assets on the Zcash chain. The creation of such assets is defined in ZIP 227 <a id="footnote-reference-4" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0227">5</a>. The transfer and burn of such assets is defined in ZIP 226 <a id="footnote-reference-5" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0226">4</a>.</p>

            <p>The current Orchard protocol does not support custom assets. Enabling multi-asset support on the Zcash chain will open the door for a host of applications and enhance the ecosystem with application developers and asset custody institutions for issuance and bridging purposes.</p>

        <section id="overview"><h2><span class="section-heading">Overview</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#overview"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>In order to be able to represent different Asset identifiers in Orchard, we need to define a new data field that uniquely represents the <cite>AssetId</cite> of the Asset in question, which we call
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{AssetId}\)</span>
            .</p>
            <p>The asset identifier will be used to enforce the balance of an Action Description <a id="footnote-reference-6" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-actions">6</a> is preserved across Assets (see the Orchard Binding Signature <a id="footnote-reference-7" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-binding">7</a>), and by extension the balance of an Orchard transaction. That is, the sum of all the
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{value^{net}}\)</span>
             from each Action Description, computed as
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{value^{old}-value^{new}}\)</span>
            , must be balanced <strong>only with respect to the same Asset identifier</strong>. This is specially important since we will allow different Action Descriptions to transfer notes of different Asset identifiers, where the overall balance is checked without revealing which Assets (or how many different identifiers) are being transferred.</p>
            <p>As was initially proposed by Jack Grigg and Daira Hopwood <a id="footnote-reference-8" class="footnote_reference" href="#initial-zsa-issue">15</a>, we propose to make this happen by changing the value base point,
                <span class="math">\(\mathcal{V}^{\mathsf{Orchard}}\)</span>
            , in the Homomorphic Pedersen Commitment that generates the value commitment,
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{cv^{net}}\)</span>
            , of the <em>net value</em> in an Orchard Action.</p>
            <p>Because in a single transaction all value commitments are balanced, there must be as many different value base points as there are asset identifiers in the transaction. We propose to make the
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{AssetId}\)</span>
             identifier an auxiliary input to the proof, represented already as a point in the Pallas curve. The circuit then should check that the same
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{AssetId}\)</span>
             is used in the old note commitment, in the new note commitment <strong>and</strong> in the value commitment as the base point of the value. This ensures that (1) the input and output notes are of the same <cite>AssetId</cite>, and (2) that only actions with the same asset identifier will balance out in the binding and balance signature.</p>
            <p>In order to ensure the security of the transfers, and as we will explain below, we are replacing input dummy notes for custom assets, as we need to enforce that the <cite>AssetId</cite> of the output note of that split action is the output of a PRF.</p>
            <p>Finally, in this ZIP we also describe the <em>burn</em> mechanism, which is a direct extension of the transfer mechanism. The burn process uses a similar mechanism than what is used in Orchard to unshield ZEC, by using the
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{valueBalance}\)</span>
             of the asset in question. Burning assets is useful for many purposes, including bridging of wrapped assets and removing supply of native assets.</p>

            <p>Most of the protocol is kept the same as the Orchard protocol released with NU5, except for the following.</p>
            <section id="asset-identifiers"><h3><span class="section-heading">Asset Identifiers</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#asset-identifiers"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h3>
                <p>For every new asset, there must be a new and unique identifier of the asset. Every asset is defined by the asset description, <cite>asset_desc</cite>, which is a global byte string (valid across all -future- Zcash protocols). From this asset description, the specific asset identifier,
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{AssetId}\)</span>
                , is derived with a <cite>GroupHash</cite> and used within the output notes, as defined by the specific protocol (e.g.: for now Orchard-style, using Pallas curve).</p>
                <p>This
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{AssetId}\)</span>
                 will be the base point of the value commitment for the specific custom asset. Note that the
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{AssetId}\)</span>
                 of the ZEC asset will be kept as the original value base-point,
                    <span class="math">\(\mathcal{V}^\mathsf{Orchard}\)</span>
                .</p>
                <p>In future network and protocol upgrades, the same asset description string can be carried on, with potentially a mapping into a different curve or group. In that case, the turnstile should know how to transform the asset identifier,
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{AssetId}\)</span>
                , from one group to another one.</p>

            <section id="note-structure-commitment"><h3><span class="section-heading">Note Structure &amp; Commitment</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#note-structure-commitment"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h3>
                <p>First, we need to adapt the components that define the assets, i.e.: <em>notes</em>. A ZSA note differs from an Orchard note by including the identifier of asset,
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{AssetId}\)</span>
                . So an ZSA note looks like:</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="math">\((\mathsf{g_d, pk_d, v, \rho, \psi, AssetId})\)</span>
                </p>
                <p>Where
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{AssetId}\)</span>
                 is the unique random group element that identifies each asset in the Pallas curve <a id="footnote-reference-9" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-pallasandvesta">8</a>, <a id="footnote-reference-10" class="footnote_reference" href="#pasta-evidence">9</a> of the Orchard protocol.</p>
                <p>In this case, the instance of the note commitment scheme,
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{NoteCommit^{OrchardZSA}_{rcm}}\)</span>
                , will differ from
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{NoteCommit^{Orchard}_{rcm}}\)</span>
                 in that for non-ZEC assets, the asset identifier will be added as an input to the commitment computation. As we will see, the recursive structure of the Sinsemilla-base commitment <a id="footnote-reference-11" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-concretesinsemillacommit">10</a> allows us to add the asset identifier as a final recursive step, and hence keep a single instance of the Sinsemilla hash function in the circuit for the note commitment verification.</p>
                <p>Since the commitment output is still indistinguishable with the original Orchard ZEC note commitments, by definition of the Sinsemilla hash, ZSA note commitments will be added to the same Merkle Commitment Tree. In essence, we have</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{NoteCommit^{OrchardZSA}_{rcm}(repr_{\mathbb{P}}(g_d), repr_{\mathbb{P}}(pk_d), v, \rho, \psi, AssetId)} \in \{\mathsf{cm},\bot\}\)</span>
                </p>
                <p>The nullifier is generated in the same manner as in the Orchard protocol.</p>

                <p>The Orchard Protocol uses a Sinsemilla-based Homomorphic Pedersen Commitment <a id="footnote-reference-12" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-concretevaluecommit">11</a> which is instantiated as</p>

                </p>
                <p>In the case of the Orchard protocol, we see that the base points
                    <span class="math">\(\mathcal{V}^{\mathsf{Orchard}}\)</span>
                 and
                    <span class="math">\(\mathcal{R}^{\mathsf{Orchard}}\)</span>
                 are fixed for every value commitment, as the values represent the amount of ZEC being transferred.</p>
                <p>In the case of the ZSA protocol, the value of different asset identifiers in a given transaction will be committed using a <strong>different value base point</strong>. This enables the final balance of the transaction to be securely computed, such that each asset identifier is balanced independently, as the assets are not meant to be fungible.

                <p>In order to verify the balance of the different assets, verifier performs exactly the same the process as for the Orchard protocol <a id="footnote-reference-13" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-binding">7</a>. The main reason is because no custom assets can be unshielded, so all custom assets are contained within the shielded ZSA pool. This means that the net balance of the input and output values is zero, with only one asset identifier of value balance published, that of ZEC,
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{v^{balanceOrchard}}\)</span>
                , so no net amount of any asset identifier will be revealed, and neither the nnumber of asset identifiers in the transaction. The only exception to this is in the case that an asset is <em>burnt</em>, as we will see below in the <a href="#burn-mechanism">burn mechanism</a>.</p>
                <p>For a total of
                    <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
                 actions in a transfer, the prover can still sign the <cite>SIGHASH</cite> of the transaction using the binding signature key</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{bsk} = \sum_{\mathsf{ \forall i\in \{1,...,n\}}} \mathsf{rcv_{i}}\)</span>
                </p>
                <p>Then the verifier MUST compute</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{bvk = (\sum cv_i^{net})}  - \mathsf{ ValueCommit_0^{Orchard}(v^{balanceOrchard})} = \sum \mathsf{rcv_{i}^{net}}\mathcal{R}^{\mathsf{Orchard}}\)</span>
                </p>
                <p>And uses it to verify the binding signature, as described in §4.14 of the Zcash Specification <a id="footnote-reference-14" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-binding">7</a>, by verifying the <cite>bindingSignature</cite> on the <cite>SIGHASH</cite> message.</p>
                <p>As in the Orchard protocol, the binding signature verification key,
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{bvk}\)</span>
                , will only be valid (and hence verify the signature correctly), as long as the committed values sum to zero. In contrast, in this protocol, the committed values only sum to zero <strong>per Asset identifier</strong>, as the Pedersen commitments add up homomorphically only with respect to the same value base point.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="split-notes"><h3><span class="section-heading">Split Notes</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#split-notes"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h3>
                <p>One of the key functionalities in a UTXO-based protocol is the fact that input notes are usually split in two (or more) output notes, as in most cases, not all the value in a single note is sent to a single output. This requires a 1-to-many (Orchard) transaction. However, because each Action represents an input and an output, the resulting transaction must have multiple inputs. In order to cope with this today, the Actions that have not been assigned input notes are instead given <em>dummy spend notes</em> <a id="footnote-reference-15" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-dummynotes">12</a>, which we call split Actions and split notes respectively. Basically, the input note is “faked” inside of the proof in order to hide which Action contains the <em>real</em> spend note.</p>
                <p>This, however, brings some issues when it comes to adding multiple asset identifiers, as the output note of the split Actions <em>cannot</em> be of <em>any</em> asset identifier, it must be enforced to be an actual output of a GroupHash computation (in fact we want it to be of the same identifier as the original input note, but the binding signature takes care that the proper balancing is performed). If not, then the prover could essentially input a multiple (or linear combination of) an existing identifier, with the goal to attack the network by overflowing the ZEC value balance and hence counterfeiting ZEC funds.</p>
                <p>In order to prevent this, we make some modifications to the circuit. Specifically we remove the dummy note functionality for custom assets and we enforce that <em>every</em> input note to an ZSA Action must be proven to exist in the set of note commitments in the Merkle Tree. We then enforce this real note to be “unspendable” in the sense that its value will be zeroed in split Actions and the nullifier will be randomized, making the note not spendable in the specific Action. Then, the proof itself ensures that the output note is of the same identifier as the input note. In the circuit, the split note functionality will be activated by a boolean private input to the proof.</p>
                <p>Note that this is enough to create a chain of induction that ensures that all output notes of a transfer are actual outputs of a GroupHash, preventing any malleability attacks, as they originate in the Issuance protocol, which is publicly verified. Furthermore, we do not care about whether the note is owned by the sender, or whether it was nullified before. Wallets and other clients have a choice to make to ensure the asset identifier is the preserved for the output note of a split Action, for the value balance verification:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>The split input note could be the same note as the original (non-split) Action,</li>
                    <li>The split input note could be a different unspent note of the same <cite>AssetId</cite> (note that the note will not actually be spent)</li>
                    <li>The split input note could be an already spent note of the same <cite>AssetId</cite> (note that by zeroing the value in the circuit, we prevent double spending)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The specific circuit changes are presented below.</p>

                <p>In order to have a "clean" backwards compatibility with the ZEC notes, we have designed the circuit to support both ZEC and ZSA notes. As we specify above, there are three main reasons we can do this: - The input notes with an asset identifer denote the ZSA custom assets, generating a note commitment that includes the asset identifer; whereas the notes without an identifier, denote the ZEC notes, and generate a note commitment that does not include the asset identifier, in order to maintain the referencability to the Merkle tree - The value commitment is abstracted to allow for the value base-point as a variable private input to the proof - The ZEC-based actions will still include dummy input notes, whereas the ZSA-based actions will include split input notes</p>

        <section id="burn-mechanism"><h2><span class="section-heading">Burn Mechanism</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#burn-mechanism"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>The burn mechanism may be needed for off-boarding the wrapped assets from the chain, or enabling advanced tokenomics on native tokens. It is part of the Issuance/Burn protocol, but given that it can be seen as an extension of the Transfer protocol, we add it here for readability.</p>
            <p>In essence, the burn mechanism is a transparent / revealing extension to the transfer protocol that enables a specific amount of any asset identifier to be sent into “oblivion”. Our burn mechanism does NOT send assets to a non-spendable address, it simply reduces the total number of assets in circulation at the consensus level. It is enforced at the consensus level, by using an extension of the value balance mechanism used for ZEC assets.</p>
            <p>First, contrary to the strict transfer transaction, we allow the sender to include a
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{valueBalance_{AssetId}}\)</span>
             variable for every asset identifier that is being burnt. As we will show in the transaction structure, this is separate from the regular
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{valueBalance^Orchard}\)</span>
             that is the default transparent value for the ZEC asset.</p>
            <p>For every custom asset that is burnt, we add to the <cite>assetBurn</cite> vector the tuple
                <span class="math">\((\mathsf{valueBalance_{AssetId}, AssetId})\)</span>
             such that the validator of the transaction can compute the value commitment with the corresponding value base point of that asset. This ensures that the values are all balanced out with respect to the asset identifiers in the transfer.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{assetBurn = [(v^{AssetId}, AssetId)}| \forall \mathsf{AssetId}  \textit{ s.t.}\mathsf{v^{AssetId}\neq 0}]\)</span>
            </p>
            <p>The value balances for each asset identifier in <cite>assetBurn</cite> represents the amount of that asset identifier that is being burnt. In the case of ZEC, the value balance represents either the transaction fee, or the amount of ZEC changing anonymity pools (to Sapling or Transparent).</p>
            <p>Finally, the validator needs to verify the Balance and Binding Signature by adding the value balances for all assets, as committed using their respective <cite>AssetId</cite> as the value base point of the Pedersen Commitment. This is done as follows</p>
            <p>
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{bvk = (\sum cv_i^{net})}  - \mathsf{ ValueCommit_0^{Orchard}(v^{balanceOrchard})} - \sum_{\forall \mathsf{AssetId}\textit{ s.t. }\mathsf{v^{AssetId}\neq 0}} \mathsf{ValueCommit_0^{ORchardZSA}(v^{AssetId}, AssetId) } = \sum \mathsf{rcv_{i,j}^{net}}\mathcal{R}^{\mathsf{Orchard}}\)</span>
            </p>
            <p>In the case that the balance of all the action values related to a specific asset will be zero, there will be no value added to the vector. This way, the number of assets, nor their identifiers will be revealed, except in the case that an asset is burnt.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Even if this mechanism allows having transparent ↔ shielded asset transfers in theory, the transparent protocol will not be changed with this ZIP to adapt to a multiple asset structure. This means that unless future consensus rules changes do allow it, the unshielding is not not be possible for custom assets.</p>

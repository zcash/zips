            <p>The key words "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. <a id="footnote-reference-1" class="footnote_reference" href="#rfc2119">1</a></p>
            <p>The term "conventional transaction fee" in this document is in reference to the value of a transaction fee that is conventionally used by wallets, and that a user can reasonably expect miners on the Zcash network to accept for including a transaction in a block.</p>
            <p>The terms "Mainnet, "Testnet", and "zatoshi" in this document are defined as in <a id="footnote-reference-2" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-networks">2</a>.</p>

            <p>The goal of this ZIP is to change the conventional fees for transactions by making them dependent on the number of inputs and outputs in a transaction, and to get buy-in for this change from wallet developers, miners and Zcash users.</p>

        <section id="motivation"><h2><span class="section-heading">Motivation</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#motivation"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>In light of recent Mainnet network activity, it is time to review and update the standard 1,000 zatoshi transaction fee set in ZIP 313 <a id="footnote-reference-3" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0313">6</a>.</p>
            <p>The conventional transaction fee presently is 0.00001 ZEC or 1,000 zatoshis, as specified in ZIP 313. This allowed exploration of novel use cases of the Zcash blockchain. The Zcash network has operated for almost 2 years at a conventional transaction fee of 1,000 zatoshis, without consideration for the total number of inputs and outputs in each transaction. Under this conventional fee, some usage of the chain has been characterized by high-output transactions with 1,100 outputs, paying the same conventional fee as a transaction with 2 outputs.</p>
            <p>The objective of the new fee policy, once it is enforced, is for fees paid by transactions to fairly reflect the processing costs that their inputs and outputs impose on various participants in the network. This will tend to discourage usage patterns that cause either intentional or unintentional denial of service, while still allowing low fees for regular transaction use cases.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The conventional fee formula should not favour or discriminate against any of the Orchard, Sapling, or transparent protocols.</li>
                <li>The fee for a transaction should scale linearly with the number of inputs and/or outputs.</li>
                <li>Users should not be penalised for sending transactions constructed with padding of inputs and outputs to reduce information leakage. (The default policy employed by zcashd and the mobile SDKs pads to two inputs and two outputs for each shielded pool used by the transaction).</li>
                <li>Users should be able to spend a small number of UTXOs or notes with value below the marginal fee per input.</li>

                <p>It is not a consensus requirement that fees follow this formula; however, wallets SHOULD create transactions that pay this fee, in order to reduce information leakage, unless overridden by the user.</p>
                <section id="rationale-for-logical-actions"><h4><span class="section-heading">Rationale for logical actions</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#rationale-for-logical-actions"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h4>
                    <p>The intention is to make the fee paid for a transaction depend on its impact on the network, without discriminating between different protocols (Orchard, Sapling, or transparent). The impact on the network depends on the numbers of inputs and outputs.</p>
                    <p>A previous proposal used
                        <span class="math">\(inputs + outputs\)</span>
                     instead of logical actions. This would have disadvantaged Orchard transactions, as a result of an Orchard Action combining an input and an output. The effect of this combining is that Orchard requires padding of either inputs or outputs to ensure that the number of inputs and outputs are the same. Usage of Sapling and transparent protocols does not require this padding, and so this could have effectively discriminated against Orchard.</p>

                        <p><strong>Why not just charge per-action, without a grace window?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This ensures that there is no penalty to padding a 1-action transaction to a 2-action transaction. Such padding is desirable to reduce information leakage from input and output arity, and is the standard approach used by <cite>zcashd</cite> and the mobile SDK transaction builder.</li>
                            <li>Without a grace window, an input with value below the marginal fee would never be worth including in the resulting transaction. With a grace window, an input with value below
                                <span class="math">\(marginal\_fee\)</span>
                             <em>is</em> worth including, if a second input is available that covers both the primary output amount and the conventional transaction fee.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Why a grace window of 2?</strong></p>
                        <p>A 1-in, 2-out (or 2-action) transaction is the smallest possible transaction that permits both an output to a recipient, and a change output. However, as stated above, <cite>zcashd</cite> and the mobile SDK transaction builder will pad the number of inputs to at least 2.</p>
                        <p>Let
                            <span class="math">\(min\_actions\)</span>
                         be the minimum number of logical actions that can be used to execute economically relevant transactions that produce change. Due to the aforementioned padding,
                            <span class="math">\(min\_actions = 2\)</span>
                        .</p>
                        <p>Having a grace window size greater than
                            <span class="math">\(min\_actions\)</span>
                         would increase the cost to create such a minimal transaction. If the cost we believe that users will tolerate for a minimal transaction is
                            <span class="math">\(B\)</span>
                        , then possible choices of
                            <span class="math">\(marginal\_fee\)</span>
                         are bounded above by
                            <span class="math">\(B / \max(min\_actions, grace\_actions)\)</span>
                        . Therefore, the optimal choice of
                            <span class="math">\(grace\_actions\)</span>
                         to maximize the per-logical-action cost of denial-of-service attacks for a given
                            <span class="math">\(B\)</span>
                        , is
                            <span class="math">\(grace\_actions = min\_actions = 2\)</span>
                        . This also ensures that a denial-of-service adversary does not gain a significant per-logical-action cost advantage by using transactions with a smaller or larger number of logical actions.</p>

                    <p>It is likely that not all wallets will immediately update to pay the (generally higher) fees specified by this ZIP. In order to be able to deploy this block template algorithm more quickly while still giving transactions created by such wallets a reasonable chance of being mined, we allow a limited number of "unpaid" logical actions in each block. Roughly speaking, if a transaction falls short of paying the conventional transaction fee by
                        <span class="math">\(k\)</span>
                     times the marginal fee, we count that as
                        <span class="math">\(k\)</span>
                     unpaid logical actions.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of how full the mempool is (according to the ZIP 401 <a id="footnote-reference-9" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0401">7</a> cost limiting), and regardless of what strategy a denial-of-service adversary may use, the number of unpaid logical actions in each block is always limited to at most
                        <span class="math">\(block\_unpaid\_action\_limit\!\)</span>
                    .</p>
                    <p>The weighting in step 2 does not create a situation where the adversary gains a significant advantage over other users by paying more than the conventional fee, for two reasons:</p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>The weight ratio cap limits the relative probability of picking a given transaction to be at most
                            <span class="math">\(weight\_ratio\_cap\)</span>
                         times greater than a transaction that pays exactly the conventional fee.</li>
                        <li>Compare the case where the adversary pays
                            <span class="math">\(c\)</span>
                         times the conventional fee for one transaction, to that where they pay the conventional fee for
                            <span class="math">\(c\)</span>
                         transactions. In the former case they are more likely to get <em>each</em> transaction into the block relative to competing transactions from other users, <em>but</em> those transactions take up less block space, all else (e.g. choice of input or output types) being equal. This is not what the attacker wants; they get a transaction into the block only at the expense of leaving more block space for the other users' transactions.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The rationale for choosing
                        <span class="math">\(weight\_ratio\_cap = 4\)</span>
                     is as a compromise between not allowing any prioritization of transactions relative to those that pay the conventional fee, and allowing arbitrary prioritization based on ability to pay.</p>

            <p>This section describes alternative proposals that have not been adopted.</p>
            <p>In previous iterations of this specification, the marginal fee was multiplied by the sum of inputs and outputs. This means that the alternatives given below are roughly half of what they would be under the current formula.</p>
            <p>Possible alternatives for the parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="math">\(marginal\_fee = 250\)</span>
                 in @nuttycom's proposal.</li>
                <li>
                    <span class="math">\(marginal\_fee = 1000\)</span>
                 adapted from @madars' proposal <a id="footnote-reference-10" class="footnote_reference" href="#madars-1">5</a>.</li>
                <li>
                    <span class="math">\(marginal\_fee = 2500\)</span>
                 in @daira's proposal.</li>
                <li>
                    <span class="math">\(marginal\_fee = 1000\)</span>
                 for Shielded, Shielding and De-shielding transactions, and
                    <span class="math">\(marginal\_fee = 10000\)</span>
                 for Transparent transactions adapted from @nighthawk24's proposal.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(In @madars' and @nighthawk24's original proposals, there was an additional
                <span class="math">\(base\_fee\)</span>
             parameter that caused the relationship between fee and number of inputs/outputs to be non-proportional above the
                <span class="math">\(grace\_actions\)</span>
             threshold. This is no longer expressible with the formula specified above.)</p>

            <p>Thanks to Madars Virza for initially proposing a fee mechanism similar to that proposed in this ZIP <a id="footnote-reference-11" class="footnote_reference" href="#madars-1">5</a>, and for finding a potential weakness in an earlier version of the block template construction algorithm. Thanks also to Kris Nuttycombe, Jack Grigg, Francisco Gindre, Greg Pfeil, Teor, and Deirdre Connolly for reviews and suggested improvements.</p>

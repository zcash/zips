            <p>This ZIP proposes a new note plaintext format for Sapling Outputs (later extended to include Orchard Actions) in transactions. The new format allows recipients to verify that the sender of an Output or Action knows the private key corresponding to the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key, in order to avoid an assumption on zk-SNARK soundness for preventing diversified address linkability.</p>

            <p>The Sapling and Orchard payment protocols have a feature called "diversified addresses" which allows a single incoming viewing key to receive payments on an enormous number of distinct and unlinkable payment addresses. This feature allows users to maintain many payment addresses without paying additional overhead during blockchain scanning.</p>
            <p>The feature works by allowing payment addresses to become a tuple
                <span class="math">\((\mathsf{pk_d}, \mathsf{d})\)</span>
             of a public key
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{pk_d}\)</span>
             and
                <span class="math">\(88\)</span>
            -bit diversifier
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             such that
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{pk_d} = [\mathsf{ivk}]\, \mathsf{DiversifyHash}(\mathsf{d})\)</span>
             for some incoming viewing key
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{ivk}\)</span>
            . The hash function
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{DiversifyHash}(\mathsf{d})\)</span>
             maps from a diversifier to prime-order elements of the Jubjub or Pallas elliptic curve. It is possible for a user to choose many
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             to create several distinct and unlinkable payment addresses of this form.</p>
            <p>In order to make a payment to a Sapling or Orchard address, an ephemeral secret
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             is sampled by the sender and an ephemeral public key
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{epk} = [\mathsf{esk}]\, \mathsf{DiversifyHash}(\mathsf{d})\)</span>
             is included in the Output or Action description. Then, a shared Diffie-Hellman secret is computed by the sender as
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{KA.Agree}(\mathsf{esk}, \mathsf{pk_d})\)</span>
            . The recipient can recover this shared secret without knowledge of the particular
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             by computing
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{KA.Agree}(\mathsf{ivk}, \mathsf{epk})\)</span>
            . This shared secret is then used as part of note decryption.</p>
            <p>Naïvely, the recipient cannot know which
                <span class="math">\((\mathsf{pk_d}, \mathsf{d})\)</span>
             was used to compute the shared secret, but the sender is asked to include the
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             within the note plaintext to reconstruct the note. However, if the recipient has more than one known address, an attacker could use a different payment address to perform secret exchange and, by observing the behavior of the recipient, link the two diversified addresses together. (This attacker strategy was discovered by Brian Warner earlier in the design of the Sapling protocol.)</p>
            <p>In order to prevent this attack before activation of this ZIP, the protocol forced the sender to prove knowledge of the discrete logarithm of
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{epk}\)</span>
             with respect to the
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{g_d} = \mathsf{DiversifyHash}(\mathsf{d})\)</span>
             included within the note commitment. This
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{g_d}\)</span>
             is determined by
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{d}\)</span>
             and recomputed during note decryption, and so either the note decryption will fail, or the sender will be unable to produce the proof that requires knowledge of the discrete logarithm.</p>
            <p>However, the latter proof was part of the Sapling Output statement, and so relied on the soundness of the underlying Groth16 zk-SNARK — hence on relatively strong cryptographic assumptions and a trusted setup. It is preferable to force the sender to transfer sufficient information in the note plaintext to allow deriving
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
            , so that, during note decryption, the recipient can check that
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{epk} = [\mathsf{esk}]\, \mathsf{g_d}\)</span>
             for the expected
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{g_d}\)</span>
            , and ignore the payment as invalid otherwise. For Sapling, this forms a line of defense in the case that soundness of the zk-SNARK does not hold. For Orchard, this check is essential because (for efficiency and simplicity)
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{epk} = [\mathsf{esk}]\, \mathsf{g_d}\)</span>
             is <em>not</em> checked in the Action statement.</p>
            <p>Merely sending
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             to the recipient in the note plaintext would require us to enlarge the note plaintext, but also would compromise the proof of IND-CCA2 security for in-band secret distribution. We avoid both of these concerns by using a key derivation to obtain both
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             and
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{rcm}\)</span>

                <p>There is a "grace period" of 32256 blocks starting from the block at which this ZIP activates, during which note plaintexts with lead byte
                    <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x01}\)</span>
                 MUST still be accepted.</p>
                <p>Let ActivationHeight be the activation height of this ZIP, and let GracePeriodEndHeight be ActivationHeight + 32256.</p>
                <p>The height of a transaction in a mined block is defined as the height of that block. An implementation MAY also decrypt mempool transactions, in which case the height used is the height of the next block at the time of the check. An implementation SHOULD NOT attempt to decrypt mempool transactions without having obtained a best-effort view of the current block chain height.</p>
                <p>When the recipient of a note (either using an incoming viewing key or a full viewing key) is able to decrypt a note plaintext, it performs the following check on the plaintext lead byte, based on the height of the containing transaction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the height is less than ActivationHeight, then only
                        <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x01}\)</span>
                     is accepted as the plaintext lead byte.</li>
                    <li>If the height is at least ActivationHeight and less than GracePeriodEndHeight, then either
                        <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x01}\)</span>
                     or
                        <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x02}\)</span>
                     is accepted as the plaintext lead byte.</li>
                    <li>If the height is at least GracePeriodEndHeight, then only
                        <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x02}\)</span>
                     is accepted as the plaintext lead byte.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the plaintext lead byte is not accepted then the note MUST be discarded. However, if an implementation decrypted the note from a mempool transaction and it was accepted at that time, but it is later mined in a block after the end of the grace period, then it MAY be retained.</p>
                <p>A note plaintext with lead byte
                    <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x02}\)</span>
                 contains a field
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{rseed}\)</span>
                 that is a
                    <span class="math">\(32\!\)</span>
                -byte sequence rather than a scalar value
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{rcm}\!\)</span>
                . The recipient, during decryption and in any later contexts, will derive
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{rcm}\)</span>
                 using
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}_{rseed}}\)</span>
                 in the same way as the sender, as described in <a href="#changes-to-the-process-of-sending-sapling-or-orchard-notes">Changes to the process of sending Sapling or Orchard notes</a>. Further, the recipient MUST derive
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
                 as described in that section and check that
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{epk} = [\mathsf{esk}]\, \mathsf{g_d}\!\)</span>
                , failing decryption if this check is not satisfied.</p>

                <p>After the activation of this ZIP, any Sapling output of a coinbase transaction that is decrypted to a note plaintext as specified in <a id="footnote-reference-17" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0213">17</a>, MUST have note plaintext lead byte equal to

                <p>Since NU5 activates after the end of the grace period <a id="footnote-reference-19" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0252">19</a>, Orchard outputs will always require a note plaintext lead byte equal to

            <p>The attack that this prevents is an interactive attack that requires an adversary to be able to break critical soundness properties of the zk-SNARKs underlying Sapling. It is potentially valid to assume that this cannot occur, due to other damaging effects on the system such as undetectable counterfeiting. However, we have attempted to avoid any instance in the protocol where privacy (even against interactive attacks) depended on strong cryptographic assumptions. Acting differently here would be confusing for users that have previously been told that "privacy does not depend on zk-SNARK soundness" or similar claims.</p>
            <p>It is possible for us to infringe on the length of the <code>memo</code> field and ask the sender to provide
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             within the existing note plaintext without modifying the transaction format, but this would harm users who have come to expect a
                <span class="math">\(512\)</span>
            -byte memo field to be available to them. Changes to the memo field length should be considered in a broader context than changes made for cryptographic purposes.</p>
            <p>It is possible to transmit a signature of knowledge of a correct
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             rather than
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             itself, but this appears to be an unnecessary complication and is likely slower than just supplying
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
            .</p>
            <p>The grace period is intended to mitigate loss-of-funds risk due to non-conformant sending wallet implementations. The intention is that during the grace period (of about 4 weeks), it will be possible to identify wallets that are still sending plaintexts according to the old specification, and cajole their developers to make the required updates. For the avoidance of doubt, such wallets are non-conformant because it is a "MUST" requirement to <em>immediately</em> switch to sending note plaintexts with lead byte
                <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x02}\)</span>
             (and the other changes in this specification) at the upgrade. Note that nodes will clear their mempools when the upgrade activates, which will clear all plaintexts with lead byte
                <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x01}\)</span>
             that were sent conformantly and not mined before the upgrade.</p>
            <p>Historical note: in practice some note plaintexts with lead byte
                <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x01}\)</span>
             were non-conformantly sent even after the end of the specified grace period. ZecWallet extended its implementation of the grace period by a further 161280 blocks (approximately 20 weeks) in order to allow for recovery of these funds <a id="footnote-reference-20" class="footnote_reference" href="#zecwallet-grace-extension">20</a>.</p>

            <p>The changes made in this proposal prevent an interactive attack that could link together diversified addresses by only breaking the knowledge soundness assumption of the zk-SNARK. It is already assumed that the adversary cannot defeat the EC-DDH assumption of the Jubjub (or Pallas) elliptic curve, for it could perform a linkability attack trivially in that case.</p>
            <p>In the naïve case where the protocol is modified so that
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{esk}\)</span>
             is supplied directly to the recipient (rather than derived through
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{rseed}\)</span>
            ) this would lead to an instance of key-dependent encryption, which is difficult or perhaps impossible to prove secure using existing security notions. Our approach of using a key derivation, which ultimately queries an oracle, allows a proof for IND-CCA2 security to be written by reprogramming the oracle to return bogus keys when necessary.</p>

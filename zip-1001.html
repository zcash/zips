            <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. <a href="#rfc2119" id="id1" class="footnote_reference">2</a></p>
            <p>For clarity this ZIP defines these terms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mining software in the context of this ZIP refers to pool software, local mining software, or staking software.</li>
                <li>Mining is defined as the action of processing transactions, so this would include proof of stake, if Zcash would switch to that.</li>
                <li>Mining coins transferred via fees are considered rewards (infinite), coins generated via block generation are considered distribution (finite).</li>
                <li>Block distribution is defined as the block reward minus transaction fees. <span class="editor-note">the protocol specification uses "block subsidy".</span></li>
                <li>Spirit is defined as what is the intended outcome of the ZIP. <a href="#spirit" id="id2" class="footnote_reference">1</a></li>
                <li>Initial promise is non-neutral language referencing the block distribution rules as initially set out. <a href="#funding" id="id3" class="footnote_reference">3</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The spirit of this ZIP is to is to ensure that the Founders’ Reward ends. It is not the intention of this ZIP to stop protocol-based donations.</p>
            <p>It is a simple short ZIP.</p>
            <p>Hopefully it will be compatible with a number of other ZIPs and can be worked into them.</p>

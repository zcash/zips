<h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “MAY”, “RECOMMENDED”,
“OPTIONAL”, and “REQUIRED” in this document are to be interpreted as
described in RFC 2119. [1]</p>
<p>The term “network upgrade” in this document is to be interpreted as
described in ZIP 200. [2]</p>
<p>“Block Subsidy” - the algorithmic issuance of ZEC on block creation.
Part of the consensus rules. Split between the miner and the Dev Fund.
Also known as Block Reward.</p>
<p>“Issuance” - The method by which ZEC becomes available for
circulation on the network.</p>
<p>“We” - the ZIP authors, owners listed in the above front matter</p>
<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>We propose to burn 60% of transaction fees, while the remaining 40%
be directed as before, providing a deflationary effect, and building the
groundwork for long-term support of the Zcash network via the new block
subsidy rules proposed by ZIP-234.</p>
<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>ZIP-233 (“Network Sustainability Mechanism: Burning”) describes a
method by which ZEC can be burned to support network sustainability.</p>
<p>By introducing a requirement that a certain proportion of transaction
fees be burned, we ensure that ZEC will be removed from circulating
supply to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the network as
described below:</p>
<h2 id="benefits-to-the-network">Benefits to the Network</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Network Sustainability</strong>: This mechanism involves
temporarily reducing the supply of ZEC, similar to asset burning in
Ethereum’s EIP-1559, but with long-term sustainability benefits, as the
burned funds effectively boost future mining rewards, making it an
attractive option for current and future Zcash users.</li>
<li><strong>Incentivizing Transaction Inclusion</strong>: By maintaining
a 40% share of transaction fees for miners, we continue incentivizing
miners to prioritize including transactions in their blocks. This helps
ensure the continued efficient processing of transactions and supports a
robust and responsive network.</li>
<li><strong>Aligning Interests:</strong> Burning transaction fees aligns
the interests of miners with the long-term health of the network,
incentivizing them to prioritize security and efficiency. As miners
focus on maintaining a robust network, overall adoption and usage can
increase, leading to higher transaction volumes in the long run. This
structure discourages short-term profit-seeking behaviors, as miners
benefit more from a stable and thriving ecosystem than from engaging in
malicious activities that could undermine the network’s reputation and
security.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proofing the Network</strong>: Burning a portion of
transaction fees is a forward-looking approach that prepares the Zcash
network for future challenges and opportunities. It establishes a
financial buffer that can be instrumental in addressing unforeseen
issues and seizing strategic advantages as the Zcash ecosystem
evolves.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>For each block, at least 60% (rounded down) of the total fees are to
be burned.</li>
<li>No restrictions are placed on the destination of the remaining
proportion of fees.</li>
<li>Any fractions are rounded in favor of the miner.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="specification">Specification</h1>
<h2 id="consensus-rule-changes">Consensus Rule Changes</h2>
<p>For a given block, the coinbase transaction MUST have a
<code>burnAmount</code> that is greater than or equal to
<code>floor(transactionFees * 6 / 10)</code>.</p>
<p>Previous transaction versions are not supported for coinbase
transactions, due to there being no explicit mechanism to burn the
required funds.</p>
<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>
<p>The implementation of this ZIP MUST be deployed at the same time or
after ZIP-233 (“NSM: Burning”), and ZIP-234 (“NSM: Issuance
Smoothing”).</p>
<h1 id="rationale">Rationale</h1>
<p>We believe the proposed changes to be relatively low-impact in terms
of implementation and protocol changes. Additionally, transaction fees
are currently small enough that the reduction in miner fees is unlikely
to be a concern.</p>
<h2 id="estimated-impact-on-miners">Estimated impact on miners</h2>
<p>Over 100,000 blocks starting at block 2235515, there were 316130
transactions. 60608 of them are categorized as ‘sandblasting’
transactions. The remaining transactions have an average of 5.46 logical
actions (see ZIP-317 [4]).</p>
<p>The total fees paid to miners from those transactions, assuming the
ZIP-317 regime, would be 87.86 ZEC. 100,000 blocks is approximately 3
months of blocks. Extrapolating to a year, we would expect 351.44 ZEC in
fees paid to miners over a year.</p>
<p>If 60% of these fees burned, that would be 210.864 ZEC per year.
[5]</p>
<h2 id="considerations-for-the-future">Considerations for the
Future</h2>
<p>If transaction fees were to increase, further modifications can
easily be proposed to alter the 60%/40% split. Finding the optimal fee
split may require an iterative approach involving adjustments based on
real-world data and network dynamics.</p>
<p>Looking further into the future, there may come a time when the
transaction fees become greater than the block subsidy issuance. At that
time we may need to reconsider the 60/40 split. However, this will
likely not be the case for the next 8-10 years due to forecasts based on
issuance models and network traffic.</p>
<p>Further ZIPs may be proposed to burn ZEC in various ways to support
network sustainability, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ZSA fees</li>
<li>Fees and donations specific to decentralized applications</li>
<li>“Storage fees” for any future data availability</li>
<li>Cross-chain bridge usage / Cross-chain messaging</li>
<li>Note sorting micro-transactional fees</li>
</ul>

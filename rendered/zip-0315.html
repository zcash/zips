            <p>Zcash wallets have to serve two purposes as a user agent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to manage the economic actions dictated by the user;</li>
                <li>to manage the privacy implications of these actions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal of this ZIP is to document security and privacy best practices when handling funds and transactions as the user's agent. These best practices are intended to provide as much privacy as is feasible by default, while still enabling the user's desired transactions to occur, and exposing any privacy implications to the user so that they have enough information to assess the consequences of their economic actions.</p>
            <p>This ZIP covers best practices for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>what information to display to the user about transactions and balances;</li>
                <li>how to handle interactions between the ZIP 32 <a id="footnote-reference-2" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0032">2</a> key tree and Unified Addresses <a id="footnote-reference-3" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0316">4</a>;</li>
                <li>when to use external or internal keys/addresses;</li>
                <li>sharing addresses and viewing keys;</li>
                <li>sending and receiving funds (including fee selection);</li>
                <li>migrating funds between pools.</li>

                <p>A wallet typically reveals some information in the process of creating a transaction. Which information is revealed depends on the configured wallet privacy policy. The guiding principle of these requirements is that users must explicitly consent to each instance of information being revealed by the wallet in a transaction.</p>
                <p>A user may give blanket consent to reveal a particular kind of information, and must also be able to change the configured wallet privacy policy to avoid the wallet creating new information leaks of a given type.</p>
                <p>The specifications below describe some situations in which blanket consent may be inappropriate.</p>
                <p>Some varieties of consent may not be revocable, for example if a user chooses to share some of their keys.</p>

            <section id="prompt-accessibility-of-funds"><h3><span class="section-heading">Prompt accessibility of funds</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#prompt-accessibility-of-funds"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h3>
                <p>Wallets need to take account of two main concerns with respect to accessibility of funds:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>enabling funds to be spent as quickly as possible to reduce latency;</li>
                    <li>ensuring that the confirmed-spendable balance is not overestimated, and so can be trusted by the user.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These concerns affect the way that balances should be computed, which notes are selected for spending, and how the wallet should ensure that sufficient notes are available to cover multiple spends within a short period.</p>
                <p>To support this we define two kinds of TXOs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A trusted TXO is a TXO received from a party where the wallet trusts that it will remain mined in its original transaction, such as TXOs created by the wallet's internal TXO handling.</li>
                    <li>An untrusted TXO is a TXO received by the wallet that is not trusted.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Wallets can then require that untrusted TXOs need more confirmations before they become confirmed-spendable than trusted TXOs. This provides an improved trade-off between latency on the one hand, and reliability and safety on the other.</p>

        <section id="specification"><h2><span class="section-heading">Specification</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#specification"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <section id="long-term-storage-of-funds"><h3><span class="section-heading">Long-term storage of funds</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#long-term-storage-of-funds"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h3>
                <p>It is RECOMMENDED that wallets only hold funds as shielded in the long term; that is, if a wallet supports receiving transparent funds (or supports importing a seed from another wallet that might have done so), then it SHOULD auto-shield such funds by default.</p>
                <p>A shielding transaction is always linked to the transparent addresses it spends from. This can cause undesirable information leaks:</p>
                <ol suffix=")" type="a">
                    <li>if there are multiple transparent addresses, they will be linked to each other;</li>
                    <li>a link between the input transparent address(es) and the payment will be visible to the recipient(s), or to any other holder of an Incoming Viewing Key for the destination address(es).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Despite the fact that it is not possible to achieve strong privacy guarantees from <em>any</em> use of transparent addresses, it is undesirable to reveal this additional information. In particular, issue b) motivates ruling out the use of "opportunistic shielding", i.e. shielding previously received transparent funds as part of a user-initiated transaction.</p>
                <p>Wallets SHOULD NOT auto-shield from multiple transparent addresses in the same transaction, and SHOULD NOT use opportunistic shielding.</p>
                <p>Following all of the recommendations in this section improves both collective privacy and the user's individual privacy, by maximizing the size of the note anonymity set over time and minimizing the potential linkage of shielding transactions to other transactions.</p>
                <p>The remainder of this specification assumes a wallet that follows all of these recommendations, except where explicitly noted.</p>
                <p>A wallet MAY allow users to disable auto-shielding, auto-migration, and/or opportunistic migration. If it does so, this need not be via three independent settings.</p>
                <p>Automatic shielding and automatic/opportunistic migration SHOULD NOT be applied to inputs where the cost of shielding or migrating them will exceed their economic value. If these transactions are paying the ZIP 317 conventional fee <a id="footnote-reference-4" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0317">5</a>, that will be the case if the amount of the UTXO to be shielded/migrated exceeds the marginal fee, and cannot be accommodated by an input that would be present in any case due to padding of the number of inputs from a given shielded pool.</p>

                <p>A wallet SHOULD treat received TXOs that are outputs of transactions created by the same wallet, as trusted TXOs. Wallets MAY enable users to mark specific external transactions as trusted, allowing their received TXOs also to be classified as trusted TXOs.</p>
                <p>A wallet SHOULD have a policy that is clearly communicated to the user for the number of confirmations needed to spend untrusted and trusted TXOs respectively. The following confirmation policy is RECOMMENDED:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>10 confirmations, for untrusted TXOs;</li>
                    <li>3 confirmations, for trusted TXOs.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>The rationale for choosing three confirmations for trusted TXOs is that anecdotally, reorgs are usually less than three blocks.</p>
                    <p>The consequences of attempting to spend a trusted TXO may be less severe in the case of a rollback than the consequences of attempting to spend an untrusted TXO. The value received from a trusted TXO should always be recoverable, whereas recovering value received from an untrusted TXO may require the user to request that funds are re-sent.</p>

                <p>A TXO is <em>known-spendable</em>, relative to a given block chain and wallet state, if and only if all of the following are true in that state:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the TXO is unspent at the wallet's view of the chain tip, and that view is reasonably up-to-date;
                        <p>TODO: consider undoing the up-to-date part, as when combined with the definition of balance below, it causes wallet balance to drop to zero in the short window between opening and updating the wallet's chain tip view.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>the TXO is not committed to be spent in another transaction created by this wallet; and</li>
                    <li>the wallet has the TXO's spending key (for whatever protocol the TXO uses).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A TXO is <em>confirmed-spendable</em>, relative to a given block chain and wallet state, if and only if all of the following are true in that state:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the wallet is synchronized; and</li>
                    <li>the TXO is known-spendable; and</li>
                    <li>either auto-shielding is not active or the TXO is shielded; and</li>
                    <li>auto-migration <em>from</em> whatever protocol the TXO uses is not active; and</li>
                    <li>the TXO is trusted and has at least the required confirmations for trusted TXOs, or it is untrusted and has at least the required confirmations for untrusted TXOs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A TXO is <em>unconfirmed-spendable</em>, relative to a given block chain and wallet state, if and only if the TXO is known-spendable but is not confirmed-spendable in that state.</p>
                <p>A TXO is <em>watch-only</em> if and only if the wallet has its full viewing key (or address in the case of a transparent TXO) but not its spending key.</p>
                <p>A wallet MUST NOT attempt to spend a TXO in a user-initiated transaction that is not confirmed-spendable.</p>
                <p>Open question: what should be specified about which TXOs can be spent in non-user-initiated transactions?</p>
                <p>Note: the definition of a TXO includes outputs in mempool transactions that are unconflicted from the perspective of the wallet.</p>

                <p>Wallets SHOULD report:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confirmed-spendable balance.</li>
                    <li>Pending balance, <em>or</em> total balance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are calculated as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The confirmed-spendable balance is the sum of values of confirmed-spendable TXOs.</li>
                    <li>The pending balance is the sum of values of unconfirmed-spendable TXOs.</li>
                    <li>The total balance is the confirmed-spendable balance plus the pending balance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: the definition of "confirmed-spendable" above ensures that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>if auto-shielding is enabled, transparent funds will be reported in the pending or total balance, but not in the confirmed-spendable balance;</li>
                    <li>if the wallet has not synchronized at least the nullifier set to the chain tip, the confirmed-spendable balance will be zero.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If auto-shielding is disabled, the wallet MAY report shielded and transparent balances separately. If it does so, it MUST make clear whether each reported balance corresponds to a confirmed-spendable, pending, or total subset of funds.</p>

                    <p>If auto-shielding is disabled, then separate shielded and transparent balances can constitute useful information. If auto-shielding is enabled then the wallet can and will automatically spend transparent TXOs in order to shield them, and so transparent TXOs need to be presented as pending, not as part of the balance spendable by the user.</p>
                    <p>Potentially, for expert users, separate shielded balances per pool could also be useful.</p>
                    <p>Open question: Does the specification of balance reporting give the user sufficient visibility into the operation of auto-shielding and pool migration/usage?</p>

                        <p>We want to support creating unlinkable addresses, in order that a user can give different addresses to different counterparties, in such a way that the counterparties (even if they collude) cannot tell that the addresses were provided by the same or distinct users.</p>
                        <p>If multiple UTXOs are received at the same transparent address, it is safe to shield them all in the same transaction, because that is not leaking additional information.</p>
                        <p>UTXOs received on different transparent receivers SHOULD NOT be shielded in the same transaction. Ideally, when they are shielded in separate transactions, this should be done in such a way that the timing of those transactions is not linkable.</p>
                        <p>TODO: move this. Daira-Emma thinks that if we only document leakage rather than explicitly say in the specification of how to construct transactions how to mitigate it, then implementors will ignore it.</p>
                        <p>When spending transparent UTXOs, they SHOULD only be sent to an internal shielded receiver belonging to the wallet, except when they are generated and spent ephemerally as part of a ZIP 320 transfer <a id="footnote-reference-5" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0320">6</a>.</p>
                        <p>A wallet MUST NOT send funds to a transparent address unless all of the source funds come from shielded pools, and this SHOULD be a single shielded pool.</p>

                <p>If no auto-migration, if you can satisfy a transfer request to Sapling from your Sapling funds, do so.</p>
                <p>The user's consent is needed to reveal amounts publically (as opposed to revealing them to the holder of a viewing key authorized to see that amount). Therefore, there should be per-transaction opt-in for any transfer that publically reveals amounts on chain.</p>

                <p>Wallets MUST NOT automatically combine funds across pools to satisfy a transfer (since that could reveal the total funds the user holds in some pool).</p>
                <p>In order to maintain the integrity of IVK guarantees, wallets should not generate unified addresses that contain internal receivers, nor expose internal receivers (such as those used for auto-shielding and change outputs) in any way.</p>

                    <p>If we want to have both automatic and opportunistic shielding, and keep the two indistinguishable, then we can't auto-shield when the transparent balance reaches some threshold (otherwise opportunistic would either never be used, or would be identifiable when it uses the balance below the threshold).</p>
                    <p>Instead, a proposition: we define a distribution of "time since last payment to the address" from which we sample the time at which the auto-shielding transaction will be created. This distribution is weighted by the balance in the address, so as more funds accrue, the auto-shielding transaction is more likely to be created.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It ensures that all funds will eventually be auto-shielded, while preventing fee-dusting attacks (where dust is sent in order to repeatedly consume fees from the wallet), as the auto-shielding transaction is not directly triggered by payment receipt.</li>
                        <li>If the user makes a shielding transaction in the meantime, we opportunistically shield, without it being clearly not an auto-shielding transaction.</li>
                        <li>If a wallet is offline for a long time, then it would likely auto-shield as soon as it finishes syncing. This maybe isn't enough to reveal that the wallet came online, except that it _might_ result in auto-shielding transactions for multiple transparent addresses being created at the same time. So we might want to special-case this?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Properties we want from auto-shielding:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Auto-shielding transactions MUST NOT shield from multiple transparent receivers in the same transaction. - Doing so would trivially link diversified UAs containing transparent receivers.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Receipt of a shielded payment MUST NOT trigger any on-chain behaviour (as that reveals transaction linkability).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Both auto-shielding and auto-migration are time-triggered actions, not receipt-triggered actions. An auto-shielding or auto-migration transaction MUST NOT be created as a direct result of a payment being received.</p>
                    <p>Both of these are opportunistic: if the user's wallet is making a transaction in which one of these actions would occur anyway, then the wallet takes the opportunity to migrate as much as it would do if it were generating an autoshielding transaction. This both saves on a transaction, and removes the need for any kind of transparent change address within UAs.</p>

                <p>In the case where we are recovering a wallet from a backed-up mnemonic phrase, and not from a wallet.dat, we don't have enough information to figure out what receiver types the user originally used when deriving each UA under an account. We have a similar issue if someone exports a UFVK, derives an address from it, and has a payment sent to the address: zcashd will detect the payment, but has no way to figure out what address it should display in the UI. A wallet could store this information in the memo field of change outputs, but that adds a bunch of coordination to the problem, and assumes ongoing on-chain state storage.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the receiver matches an address that the wallet knows was derived via <code>z_getaddressforaccount</code>, show that UA as expected (matching the receiver types the user selected).</li>
                    <li>If the receiver matches a UFVK in the wallet, and we are looking it up because we detected a received note in some block, show the UA with the default receiver types that zcashd was using as of that block height (ideally the earliest block height we detect), and cache this for future usage.</li>
                    <li>For zcashd's current policy of "best and second-best shielded pools, plus transparent pool", that would mean Orchard, Sapling, and transparent for current block heights.</li>
                    <li>For each release of a wallet, the wallet should specify a set of receiver types and an associated range of block heights during which the wallet will, by default, generate unified addresses using that set of receiver types.</li>
                    <li>For zcashd we know how the policy evolves because each zcashd release has an approximate release height and End-of-Service height that defines the window.</li>
                    <li>Subsequent releases of a wallet SHOULD NOT retroactively change their policies for previously defined block height ranges.</li>
                    <li>If the receiver type for a note received at a given time is not a member of the set of receiver types expected for the range of block heights, the policy corresponding to the nearest block height range that includes that receiver type SHOULD be used.</li>
                    <li>If the receiver matches a UFVK in the wallet, and we have no information about when this receiver may have been first used, show the UA corresponding to the most recent receiver types policy that includes the receiver's type.</li>
                    <li>As part of this, we're also going to change the "Sapling receiver to UfvkId" logic to trial-decrypt after trying internal map, so that we will detect all receivers linked to UFVKs in the wallet, not just receivers in addresses generated via z_getaddressforaccount. The internal map lookup is then just an optimisation (and a future refactor to have Orchard do the same is possible, but for now we will only trial-decrypt so we don't need to refactor to access the Rust wallet).

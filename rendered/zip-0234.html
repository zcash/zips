<p>This ZIP proposes a change to how nodes calculate the block subsidy.</p>

<p>Instead of following a step function around the 4-year halving intervals
inherited from Bitcoin, we propose a smooth logarithmic curve, defined as a
fixed portion of the current value of the Money Reserve at a given block height.</p>

<p>The new issuance scheme would approximate the current issuance over 4-year
intervals, assuming no ZEC/TAZ is burned during that time, and retains the
overall supply cap of <code>MAX_MONEY</code>.</p>

<h1 id="motivation"><span class="section-heading">Motivation</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#motivation"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h1>

<p>Key Objectives:</p>

<ol>
<li>We want to introduce an automated mechanism that allows users of the network
to contribute to the long-term sustainability of the network.</li>
<li>We want to enable ZEC that has been burned to be recreated in the future to
benefit network sustainability.</li>
<li>We want to retain the existing ZEC supply cap of 21 million.</li>
<li>We want the issuance rate to remain similar to the historical rate for Zcash
(and before that, Bitcoin).</li>
<li>We want issuance to be easy for all network users to understand and predict.</li>
<li>We want the new issuance to activate at a block with as minimal a delta from
the current issuance as possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>The current Zcash economic model, inherited from Bitcoin, includes a halving
mechanism that dictates the issuance of new coins. While this has been
foundational, halvings can lead to abrupt changes in the rate of new coins
being introduced to the market. Such sudden shifts can potentially disrupt the
network&#8217;s economic model, potentially impacting its security and stability.
Furthermore, the halvings schedule is fixed and does not provide any way to
&#8220;recycle&#8221; funds into future issuance.</p>

<p>This new NSM-based issuance scheme solves these problems by ensuring a more
consistent and predictable rate of coin issuance, while preserving the core
aspects of Zcash&#8217;s issuance policy and the 21-million-coin cap. At the same
time, it introduces the first mechanism to recreate and distribute ZEC that has
been removed from circulation, as well as unclaimed transaction fees, across
future block subsidies.</p>

<p>Smoothing the issuance curve is possible using an exponential decay formula
that satisfies the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>The issuance can be summarized into a reasonably simple explanation.</li>
<li>Block subsidies approximate a continuous function.</li>
<li>If the Money Reserve is greater than 0, then the block subsidy must be
non-zero, preventing any final &#8220;unmined&#8221; zatoshis.</li>
<li>For any 4-year period, all paid out block subsidies are approximately equal
to half of the Money Reserve at the beginning of that 4-year period, if no
ZEC is burned during those 4 years.</li>
<li>Decrease the short-term impact of the deployment of this ZIP on block subsidy
recipients, and minimize the potential reputation risk to Zcash of changing
the block subsidy amount.</li>
<li>The immediate change in issuance when this mechanism activates should be
minimal.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="parameters"><span class="section-heading">Parameters</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#parameters"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>

<p><span class="math">\(\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION} = 4126 / 10\_000\_000\_000 = 0.0000004126\)</span></p>

<p><span class="math">\(\mathsf{DEPLOYMENT\_BLOCK\_HEIGHT} = \mathsf{TBD}\)</span></p>

<p>The block height will be chosen by the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is after NU7 activation height.</li>
<li>It is calculated to be the lowest height after the second halving at
which the NSM issuance would be less than the current BTC-style issuance
<em>neglecting</em> any burnt ZEC (i.e. assuming the amount of ZEC burnt is
exactly 0).</li>
</ul>

<p>This selection is intended to achieve Key Objective 6 while still being at
a constant, predictable height. An alternative would be to have a dynamic
&#8220;latch&#8221;-style activation, which would calculate the activation height by
testing the &#8220;less than&#8221; conditional with every block after the second halving.
We prefer the pre-defined constant height parameter, to give everyone more
<em>time</em> certainty at the cost of <em>issuance level</em> certainty.</p>

<p>The difference in up-front calculation versus dynamic calculation is in
whether or not burns are accounted for (since future burns cannot be
calculated up-front). This means with the pre-defined constant parameter
approach, issuance will jump <em>up</em> some amount at activation. This amount
should be equivalent to all ZEC burnt prior to that height times
<span class="math">\(\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION}\)</span>. For example, if a total of 100,000 ZEC
were burnt prior to the pre-defined constant activation height, then at
activation the issuance would be larger than BTC-style issuance by
<span class="math">\(100\_000\textsf{ ZEC} \cdot \mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION}\)</span>,
which we calculate equals <span class="math">\(0.04126\)</span> ZEC. This example is chosen to
demonstrate that a very large burn amount (much larger than expected) would
elevate issuance by a relatively small amount. For this reason, we believe
a pre-defined constant is a better approach to achieving Key Objective 6
than a &#8220;dynamic latch&#8221; logic because it is so much simpler to implement
and reason about.</p>

<p>At the <span class="math">\(\mathsf{DEPLOYMENT\_BLOCK\_HEIGHT}\)</span>, nodes should switch from the current issuance
calculation, to the following:</p>

<p><span class="math">\(\mathsf{BlockSubsidy}(\mathsf{height}) = \mathsf{ceiling}(\mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION} \cdot \mathsf{MoneyReserveAfter}(\mathsf{height} - 1))\)</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Using an exponential decay function satisfies <strong>Requirements 1</strong> and <strong>2</strong> above.</li>
<li>We round up to the next zatoshi to satisfy <strong>Requirement 3</strong> above.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="block_subsidy_fraction"><span class="section-heading">BLOCK_SUBSIDY_FRACTION</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#block_subsidy_fraction"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>

<p>Let <span class="math">\(\mathsf{IntendedMoneyReserveFractionRemainingAfterFourYears} = 0.5\)</span>.</p>

<p>The value <span class="math">\(4126 / 10\_000\_000\_000\)</span> satisfies the approximation within <span class="math">\(\pm 0.002\%\)</span>:</p>

<p><span class="math">\((1 - \mathsf{BLOCK\_SUBSIDY\_FRACTION})^\mathsf{PostBlossomHalvingInterval} \approx \mathsf{IntendedMoneyReserveFractionRemainingAfterFourYears}\)</span></p>

<p>This implies that after a period of 4 years around half of Money Reserve will
have been issued as block subsidies, thus satisfying <strong>Requirement 4</strong>.</p>

<p>The largest possible value in the Money Reserve is <span class="math">\(\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY}\)</span>, in the
theoretically possible case that all issued funds are burned. If this happened,
the largest interim sum in the block subsidy calculation would be
<span class="math">\(\mathsf{MAX\_MONEY} \cdot 4126 / 10\_000\_000\_000\)</span>.</p>

<p>This uses 62.91 bits, which is just under the 63-bit limit for signed
two&#8217;s complement 64-bit integer amount types.</p>

<p>The numerator could be brought closer to the limit by using a larger
denominator, but the difference in the amount issued would be very small. So we
chose a power-of-10 denominator for simplicity.</p>

<p>TODO for ZIP owners: How many ZEC per day?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/eigerco/zsf-simulator">NSM Simulator</a> allows us to
simulate the effects of this ZIP on the Money Reserve and the block subsidy, as
well as generate plots like the ones above. Its output:</p>

<pre><code>Last block is 47917869 in ~113.88 years
</code></pre>

<p>indicates that, assuming that no ZEC is ever burned, the Money Reserve will be
depleted after 113.88 years, and the block subsidy will be 0 ZEC after that
point.</p>

<p>This fragment of the output:</p>

<pre><code>Halving  1 at block  1680000:
  NSM subsidies:    262523884819889 (~ 2625238.848 ZEC,        1.563 ZEC per block)
  legacy subsidies: 262500000000000 (~ 2625000.000 ZEC,        1.562 ZEC per block)
  difference:           23884819889 (~         238 ZEC),         NSM/legacy: 1.0001
</code></pre>

<p>shows that the difference between the smoothed out and the current issuance
schemes is 238 ZEC after 1680000 blocks (around 4 years).</p>

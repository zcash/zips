Abstract
========

This proposal defines a new transaction digest algorithm for signature verification from the Sapling network
upgrade, to account for the presence of Sapling shielded inputs and outputs in transactions.


Motivation
==========

The Sapling network upgrade introduced new shielded inputs and outputs. We want these to be covered by the
transaction digest algorithm used for signatures, in order to ensure they are correctly bound.


Specification
=============

A new transaction digest algorithm is defined::

  BLAKE2b-256 hash of the serialization of:
    1. header of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
    2. nVersionGroupId of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
    3. hashPrevouts (32-byte hash)
    4. hashSequence (32-byte hash)
    5. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
    6. hashJoinSplits (32-byte hash)
    7. hashShieldedSpends (32-byte hash)
    8. hashShieldedOutputs (32-byte hash)
    9. nLockTime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
   10. nExpiryHeight of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
   11. valueBalance of the transaction (8-byte little endian)
   12. sighash type of the signature (4-byte little endian)

   13. If we are serializing a transparent input (i.e. this hash is not for a JoinSplit signature,
       Spend authorization signature, or binding signature):
       a. outpoint (32-byte hash + 4-byte little endian) 
       b. scriptCode of the input (serialized as scripts inside CTxOuts)
       c. value of the output spent by this input (8-byte little endian)
       d. nSequence of the input (4-byte little endian)

The new algorithm is based on the transaction digest algorithm defined in ZIP 143 [#zip-0143]_.

The new algorithm MUST be used for signatures created over the Sapling transaction format [#zip-0XXX]_.
Combined with the new consensus rule that v3 transaction formats will be invalid from the Sapling upgrade
[#zip-0XXX]_, this effectively means that all transaction signatures from the Sapling activation height will
use the new algorithm [#zip-0XXX]_.

The BLAKE2b-256 personalization field [#BLAKE2-personalization]_ is set to::

  "ZcashSigHash" || CONSENSUS_BRANCH_ID

``CONSENSUS_BRANCH_ID`` is the little-endian encoding of ``BRANCH_ID`` for the epoch of the block containing
the transaction. [#zip-0200]_ Domain separation of the signature hash across parallel branches provides replay
protection: transactions targeted for one branch will have invalid signatures on other branches.

Transaction creators MUST specify the epoch they want their transaction to be mined in. Across a network
upgrade, this means that if a transaction is not mined before the activation height, it will never be mined.

Semantics of the original sighash types are as in ZIP 143 [#zip-0143]_.

Field definitions
-----------------

The items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, and 13 have the same meaning as in ZIP 143 [#zip-0143]_.

6: ``hashJoinSplits``
`````````````````````
* If ``vjoinsplits`` is non-empty, ``hashJoinSplits`` is the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the serialization of all
  JoinSplit descriptions (in their canonical v4 transaction serialization format) concatenated with the
  ``joinSplitPubKey``;

  * The BLAKE2b-256 personalization field is set to ``ZcashJSplitsHash``.

  * Note that while signatures are ommitted, the JoinSplit proofs are included in the signature hash, as with
    v1, v2, and v3 transactions.

* Otherwise, ``hashJoinSplits`` is a ``uint256`` of ``0x0000......0000``.

7: ``hashShieldedSpends``
`````````````````````````

* If ``vShieldedSpend`` is non-empty, ``hashShieldedSpends`` is the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the serialization of
  all Spend Descriptions (in their canonical transaction serialization format minus ``spendAuthSig``);

  * The BLAKE2b-256 personalization field is set to ``ZcashSSpendsHash``.

  * Note that the Spend proofs are included in the signature hash, as with JoinSplit proofs in v1, v2, and v3
    transactions.

* Otherwise, ``hashShieldedSpends`` is a ``uint256`` of ``0x0000......0000``.

8: ``hashShieldedOutputs``
``````````````````````````

* If ``vShieldedOutput`` is non-empty, ``hashShieldedOutputs`` is the BLAKE2b-256 hash of the serialization of
  all Output Descriptions (in their canonical transaction serialization format);

  * The BLAKE2b-256 personalization field is set to ``ZcashSOutputHash``.

  * Note that the Output proofs are included in the signature hash, as with JoinSplit proofs in v1, v2, and v3
    transactions.

* Otherwise, ``hashShieldedOutputs`` is a ``uint256`` of ``0x0000......0000``.

11: ``valueBalance``
````````````````````
An 8-byte signed two's-complement little-endian value of the net amount, in zatoshi, exiting the Sapling value
pool. For clarity, a negative value corresponds to an amount *entering* the Sapling value pool.

Notes
-----

The ``hashPrevouts``, ``hashSequence``, ``hashOutputs``, ``hashJoinSplits``, ``hashShieldedSpends``, and
``hashShieldedOutputs`` calculated in an earlier verification can be reused in other inputs of the same
transaction, so that the time complexity of the whole hashing process reduces from O(n\ :sup:`2`) to O(n).

Refer to the reference implementation, reproduced below, for the precise algorithm:

Example
=======

TBC


Deployment
==========

This proposal is deployed with the Sapling network upgrade. [#zip-0XXX]_


Backward compatibility
======================

This proposal is backwards-compatible with old UTXOs. It is **not** backwards-compatible with older software.
All transactions will be required to use this transaction digest algorithm for signatures, and so transactions
created by older software will be rejected by the network.

Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [#RFC2119]_

"Jubjub" refers to the elliptic curve defined in [#protocol-jubjub]_.

A "chain code" is a cryptovalue that is needed, in addition to a spending key, in order to derive
descendant keys and addresses of that key.

The terms "Testnet" and "Mainnet" are to be interpreted as described in section 3.12 of the Zcash
Protocol Specification [#protocol-networks]_.


Abstract
========

This proposal defines a mechanism for extending hierarchical deterministic wallets, as decribed in BIP 32
[#bip-0032]_, to support Zcash's shielded addresses.

The initial parts of the specification define (mostly) equivalent, but independent, systems for deriving a
tree of key components from a single seed, for the following shielded pools (which have different internal
key structures):

- Sapling
- Orchard

Previous versions of this document also defined a similar derivation system for the Sprout shielded pool.
This has been removed since it was never used, and is unlikely to be used given that `zcashd` no longer
generates Sprout addresses (and neither `Zebra` nor the mobile SDKs have ever done so).

The last part shows how to use these trees in the context of existing BIP 44 [#bip-0044]_ wallets.

This specification complements the existing use by some Zcash wallets of BIP 32 and BIP 44 for transparent
Zcash addresses, and is not intended to deprecate that usage (privacy risks of using transparent addresses
notwithstanding).


Motivation
==========

BIP 32 [#bip-0032]_ is the standard mechanism by which wallets for Bitcoin and its derivatives (including
Zcash's transparent addresses [#slip-0044]_) generate keys and addresses deterministically. This has several
advantages over random generation:

- Wallets only need to store a single seed (particularly useful for hardware wallets).
- A one-time backup of the seed (usually stored as a word phrase [#bip-0039]_) can be used to recover funds
  from all future addresses.
- Keys are arranged into a tree of chains, enabling wallets to represent "accounts" or other high-level
  structures.
- Viewing authority or spending authority can be delegated independently for sub-trees without compromising
  the master seed.

At present, no such equivalent exists for Zcash's shielded addresses. This is of particular concern for
hardware wallets; all currently-marketed devices only store a seed internally, and have trained their users
to only backup that seed. Given that the Sapling upgrade will make it feasible to use hardware wallets with
shielded addresses, it is desirable to have a standard mechanism for deriving them.


Conventions
===========

Most of the notation and functions used in this ZIP are defined in the Zcash protocol specification
[#protocol]_. They are reproduced here for convenience:

- :math:`\mathsf{truncate}_k(S)` means the sequence formed from the first :math:`k` elements of :math:`S`.

- :math:`a\,||\,b` means the concatenation of sequences :math:`a` then :math:`b`.

- :math:`[k] P` means scalar multiplication of the elliptic curve point :math:`P` by the scalar :math:`k`.

- :math:`\mathsf{LEOS2IP}_\ell(S)` is the integer in range :math:`\{ 0\,.\!. 2^\ell - 1 \}` represented in
  little-endian order by the byte sequence :math:`S` of length :math:`\ell/8`.

- :math:`\mathsf{I2LEBSP}_\ell(k)` is the sequence of :math:`\ell` bits representing :math:`k` in
  little-endian order.

- :math:`\mathsf{LEBS2OSP}_\ell(B)` is defined as follows when :math:`\ell` is a multiple of :math:`8`:
  convert each group of 8 bits in :math:`B` to a byte value with the least significant bit first, and
  concatenate the resulting bytes in the same order as the groups.

- :math:`\mathsf{repr}_\mathbb{J}(P)` is the representation of the Jubjub elliptic curve point :math:`P`
  as a bit sequence, defined in [#protocol-jubjub]_.

- :math:`\mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{256}(p, x)` refers to unkeyed BLAKE2b-256 in sequential mode,
  with an output digest length of 32 bytes, 16-byte personalization string :math:`p`, and input :math:`x`.

- :math:`\mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{512}(p, x)` refers to unkeyed BLAKE2b-512 in sequential mode,
  with an output digest length of 64 bytes, 16-byte personalization string :math:`p`, and input :math:`x`.

- :math:`\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(\mathsf{sk}, t) :=`:math:`\mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{512}(\texttt{“Zcash_ExpandSeed”},`:math:`\mathsf{sk}\,||\,t)`

- :math:`r_\mathbb{J}` is the order of the Jubjub large prime subgroup.

- :math:`\mathsf{ToScalar^{Orchard}}(x) :=`:math:`\mathsf{LEOS2IP}_{512}(x) \pmod{r_\mathbb{P}}`.

- :math:`\mathsf{DiversifyHash^{Sapling}}(d)` maps a diversifier :math:`d` to a base point on the Jubjub elliptic
  curve, or to :math:`\bot` if the diversifier is invalid. It is instantiated in [#protocol-concretediversifyhash]_.

The following algorithm standardized in [#NIST-SP-800-38G]_ is used:

- :math:`\mathsf{FF1}\text{-}\mathsf{AES256.Encrypt}(key, tweak, x)` refers to the FF1 encryption algorithm
  using AES with a 256-bit :math:`key`, and parameters :math:`radix = 2,`:math:`minlen = 88,`:math:`maxlen = 88`.
  It will be used only with the empty string :math:`\texttt{“”}` as the :math:`tweak`. :math:`x` is a
  sequence of 88 bits, as is the output.

We also define the following conversion function:

- :math:`\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_\ell(k)` is the byte sequence :math:`S` of length :math:`\ell/8` representing in
  little-endian order the integer :math:`k` in range :math:`\{ 0\,.\!. 2^\ell - 1 \}`. It is the reverse
  operation of :math:`\mathsf{LEOS2IP}_\ell(S)`.

Implementors should note that this ZIP is consistently little-endian (in keeping with the Sapling and Orchard
specifications), which is the opposite of BIP 32.

We adapt the path notation of BIP 32 [#bip-0032]_ to describe shielded HD paths, using prime marks (:math:`'`) to
indicate hardened derivation (:math:`i' = i + 2^{31}`) as in BIP 44 [#bip-0044]_:

- :math:`\mathsf{CDKfvk}(\mathsf{CDKfvk}(\mathsf{CDKfvk}(m_\mathsf{Sapling}, a), b), c)` is written as :math:`m_\mathsf{Sapling} / a / b / c`.


Specification: Sapling key derivation
=====================================

Sapling extended keys
---------------------

BIP 32 defines a method to derive a number of child keys from a parent key. In order to prevent these from
depending solely on the parent key itself, both the private and public keys are extended with a 32-byte chain
code. We similarly extend Sapling keys with a chain code here. However, the concepts of "private" and "public"
keys in BIP 32 do not map cleanly to Sapling's key components. We take the following approach:

- We derive child Sapling expanded spending keys, rather than Sapling spending keys. This enables us to
  implement both hardened and non-hardened derivation modes (the latter being incompatible with Sapling
  spending keys).

- We do not derive Sapling public keys directly, as this would prevent the use of diversified addresses.
  Instead, we derive Sapling full viewing keys, from which payment addresses can be generated. This maintains
  the trust semantics of BIP 32: someone with access to a BIP 32 extended public key is able to view all
  transactions involving that address, which a Sapling full viewing key also enables.

We represent a Sapling extended spending key as :math:`(\mathsf{ask, nsk, ovk, dk, c})`, where
:math:`(\mathsf{ask, nsk, ovk})` is the normal Sapling expanded spending key, :math:`\mathsf{dk}` is a
diversifier key, and :math:`\mathsf{c}` is the chain code.

We represent a Sapling extended full viewing key as :math:`(\mathsf{ak, nk, ovk, dk, c})`, where
:math:`(\mathsf{ak, nk, ovk})` is the normal Sapling full viewing key, :math:`\mathsf{dk}` is the same
diversifier key as above, and :math:`\mathsf{c}` is the chain code.

Sapling helper functions
------------------------

Define

* :math:`\mathsf{EncodeExtSKParts}(\mathsf{ask, nsk, ovk, dk}) :=`:math:`\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{256}(\mathsf{ask})`:math:`||\,\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{256}(\mathsf{nsk})`:math:`||\,\mathsf{ovk}`:math:`||\,\mathsf{dk}`
* :math:`\mathsf{EncodeExtFVKParts}(\mathsf{ak, nk, ovk, dk}) :=`:math:`\mathsf{LEBS2OS}_{256}(\mathsf{repr}_\mathbb{J}(\mathsf{ak}))`:math:`||\,\mathsf{LEBS2OSP}_{256}(\mathsf{repr}_\mathbb{J}(\mathsf{nk}))`:math:`||\,\mathsf{ovk}`:math:`||\,\mathsf{dk}`

Sapling master key generation
-----------------------------

Let :math:`S` be a seed byte sequence of a chosen length, which MUST be at least 32 and at most 252 bytes.

- Calculate :math:`I = \mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{512}(\texttt{“ZcashIP32Sapling”}, S)`.
- Split :math:`I` into two 32-byte sequences, :math:`I_L` and :math:`I_R`.
- Use :math:`I_L` as the master spending key :math:`\mathsf{sk}_m`, and :math:`I_R` as the master chain code
  :math:`\mathsf{c}_m`.
- Calculate :math:`\mathsf{ask}_m`, :math:`\mathsf{nsk}_m`, and :math:`\mathsf{ovk}_m` via the standard
  Sapling derivation [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_:

  - :math:`\mathsf{ask}_m = \mathsf{ToScalar^{Sapling}}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(\mathsf{sk}_m, [\texttt{0x00}]))`
  - :math:`\mathsf{nsk}_m = \mathsf{ToScalar^{Sapling}}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(\mathsf{sk}_m, [\texttt{0x01}]))`
  - :math:`\mathsf{ovk}_m = \mathsf{truncate}_{32}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(\mathsf{sk}_m, [\texttt{0x02}]))`.

- Calculate :math:`\mathsf{dk}_m` similarly:

  - :math:`\mathsf{dk}_m = \mathsf{truncate}_{32}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(\mathsf{sk}_m, [\texttt{0x10}]))`.

- Return :math:`(\mathsf{ask}_m, \mathsf{nsk}_m, \mathsf{ovk}_m, \mathsf{dk}_m, \mathsf{c}_m)` as the
  master extended spending key :math:`m_\mathsf{Sapling}`.

Note that the master extended key is invalid if :math:`\mathsf{ask}_m` is :math:`0`, or if the corresponding
:math:`\mathsf{ivk}` derived as specified in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_ is :math:`0`.

Sapling child key derivation
----------------------------

As in BIP 32, the method for deriving a child extended key, given a parent extended key and an index :math:`i`,
depends on the type of key being derived, and whether this is a hardened or non-hardened derivation.

Deriving a child extended spending key
``````````````````````````````````````

:math:`\mathsf{CDKsk}((\mathsf{ask}_{par}, \mathsf{nsk}_{par}, \mathsf{ovk}_{par}, \mathsf{dk}_{par}, \mathsf{c}_{par}), i)`:math:`\rightarrow (\mathsf{ask}_i, \mathsf{nsk}_i, \mathsf{ovk}_i, \mathsf{dk}_i, \mathsf{c}_i)`

- Check whether :math:`i \geq 2^{31}` (whether the child is a hardened key).

  - If so (hardened child):
    let :math:`I = \mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(\mathsf{c}_{par}, [\texttt{0x11}]`:math:`||\,\mathsf{EncodeExtSKParts}(\mathsf{ask}_{par}, \mathsf{nsk}_{par}, \mathsf{ovk}_{par}, \mathsf{dk}_{par})`:math:`||\,\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{32}(i))`.
  - If not (normal child):
    let :math:`I = \mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(\mathsf{c}_{par}, [\texttt{0x12}]`:math:`||\,\mathsf{EncodeExtFVKParts}(\mathsf{ak}_{par}, \mathsf{nk}_{par}, \mathsf{ovk}_{par}, \mathsf{dk}_{par})`:math:`||\,\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{32}(i))`
    where :math:`(\mathsf{nk}_{par}, \mathsf{ak}_{par}, \mathsf{ovk}_{par})` is the full viewing key derived from
    :math:`(\mathsf{ask}_{par}, \mathsf{nsk}_{par}, \mathsf{ovk}_{par})` as described in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_.

- Split :math:`I` into two 32-byte sequences, :math:`I_L` and :math:`I_R`.
- Let :math:`I_\mathsf{ask} = \mathsf{ToScalar^{Sapling}}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I_L, [\texttt{0x13}]))`.
- Let :math:`I_\mathsf{nsk} = \mathsf{ToScalar^{Sapling}}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I_L, [\texttt{0x14}]))`.
- Return:

  - :math:`\mathsf{ask}_i = (I_\mathsf{ask} + \mathsf{ask}_{par}) \pmod{r_\mathbb{J}}`
  - :math:`\mathsf{nsk}_i = (I_\mathsf{nsk} + \mathsf{nsk}_{par}) \pmod{r_\mathbb{J}}`
  - :math:`\mathsf{ovk}_i = \mathsf{truncate}_{32}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I_L, [\texttt{0x15}]`:math:`||\,\mathsf{ovk}_{par}))`
  - :math:`\mathsf{dk}_i  = \mathsf{truncate}_{32}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I_L, [\texttt{0x16}]`:math:`||\,\mathsf{dk}_{par}))`
  - :math:`\mathsf{c}_i   = I_R`.

Note that the child extended key is invalid if :math:`\mathsf{ask}_i` is :math:`0`, or if the corresponding
:math:`\mathsf{ivk}` derived as specified in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_ is :math:`0`.

Deriving a child extended full viewing key
``````````````````````````````````````````

Let :math:`\mathcal{G}^\mathsf{Sapling}` be as defined in [#protocol-concretespendauthsig]_ and
let :math:`\mathcal{H}^\mathsf{Sapling}` be as defined in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_.

:math:`\mathsf{CDKfvk}((\mathsf{ak}_{par}, \mathsf{nk}_{par}, \mathsf{ovk}_{par}, \mathsf{dk}_{par}, \mathsf{c}_{par}), i)`:math:`\rightarrow (\mathsf{ak}_{i}, \mathsf{nk}_{i}, \mathsf{ovk}_{i}, \mathsf{dk}_{i}, \mathsf{c}_{i})`

- Check whether :math:`i \geq 2^{31}` (whether the child is a hardened key).

  - If so (hardened child): return failure.
  - If not (normal child):  let
    :math:`I = \mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(\mathsf{c}_{par}, [\texttt{0x12}]`:math:`||\,\mathsf{EncodeExtFVKParts}(\mathsf{ak}_{par}, \mathsf{nk}_{par}, \mathsf{ovk}_{par}, \mathsf{dk}_{par})`:math:`||\,\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{32}(i))`.

- Split :math:`I` into two 32-byte sequences, :math:`I_L` and :math:`I_R`.
- Let :math:`I_\mathsf{ask} = \mathsf{ToScalar^{Sapling}}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I_L, [\texttt{0x13}]))`.
- Let :math:`I_\mathsf{nsk} = \mathsf{ToScalar^{Sapling}}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I_L, [\texttt{0x14}]))`.
- Return:

  - :math:`\mathsf{ak}_i  = [I_\mathsf{ask}]\,\mathcal{G}^\mathsf{Sapling} + \mathsf{ak}_{par}`
  - :math:`\mathsf{nk}_i  = [I_\mathsf{nsk}]\,\mathcal{H}^\mathsf{Sapling} + \mathsf{nk}_{par}`
  - :math:`\mathsf{ovk}_i = \mathsf{truncate}_{32}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I_L, [\texttt{0x15}]`:math:`||\,\mathsf{ovk}_{par}))`
  - :math:`\mathsf{dk}_i  = \mathsf{truncate}_{32}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I_L, [\texttt{0x16}]`:math:`||\,\mathsf{dk}_{par}))`
  - :math:`\mathsf{c}_i   = I_R`.

Note that the child extended key is invalid if :math:`\mathsf{ak}_i` is the zero point of Jubjub,
or if the corresponding :math:`\mathsf{ivk}` derived as specified in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_
is :math:`0`.

Sapling internal key derivation
-------------------------------

The above derivation mechanisms produce external addresses suitable for giving out to senders.
We also want to be able to produce another address derived from a given external address, for
use by wallets for internal operations such as change and auto-shielding. Unlike BIP 44 that
allows deriving a stream of external and internal addresses in the same hierarchical derivation
tree [#bip-0044]_, for any external full viewing key we only need to be able to derive a single
internal full viewing key that has viewing authority for just internal transfers. We also need
to be able to derive the corresponding internal spending key if we have the external spending
key.

Deriving a Sapling internal spending key
````````````````````````````````````````

Let :math:`(\mathsf{ask}, \mathsf{nsk}, \mathsf{ovk}, \mathsf{dk})` be the external spending key.

- Derive the corresponding :math:`\mathsf{ak}` and :math:`\mathsf{nk}` as specified in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_.
- Let :math:`I = \textsf{BLAKE2b-256}(\texttt{"Zcash_SaplingInt"}, \mathsf{EncodeExtFVKParts}(\mathsf{ak}, \mathsf{nk}, \mathsf{ovk}, \mathsf{dk}))`.
- Let :math:`I_\mathsf{nsk} = \mathsf{ToScalar^{Sapling}}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I, [\mathtt{0x17}]))`.
- Let :math:`R = \mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I, [\mathtt{0x18}])`.
- Let :math:`\mathsf{nsk_{internal}} = (I_\mathsf{nsk} + \mathsf{nsk}) \pmod{r_\mathbb{J}}`.
- Split :math:`R` into two 32-byte sequences, :math:`\mathsf{dk_{internal}}` and :math:`\mathsf{ovk_{internal}}`.
- Return the internal spending key as :math:`(\mathsf{ask}, \mathsf{nsk_{internal}}, \mathsf{ovk_{internal}}, \mathsf{dk_{internal}})`.

Note that the child extended key is invalid if :math:`\mathsf{ak}` is the zero point of Jubjub,
or if the corresponding :math:`\mathsf{ivk}` derived as specified in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_
is :math:`0`.

Deriving a Sapling internal full viewing key
````````````````````````````````````````````

Let :math:`\mathcal{H}^\mathsf{Sapling}` be as defined in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_.

Let :math:`(\mathsf{ak}, \mathsf{nk}, \mathsf{ovk}, \mathsf{dk})` be the external full viewing key.

- Let :math:`I = \textsf{BLAKE2b-256}(\texttt{"Zcash_SaplingInt"}, \mathsf{EncodeExtFVKParts}(\mathsf{ak}, \mathsf{nk}, \mathsf{ovk}, \mathsf{dk}))`.
- Let :math:`I_\mathsf{nsk} = \mathsf{ToScalar^{Sapling}}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I, [\mathtt{0x17}]))`.
- Let :math:`R = \mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(I, [\mathtt{0x18}])`.
- Let :math:`\mathsf{nk_{internal}} = [I_\mathsf{nsk}] \mathcal{H}^\mathsf{Sapling} + \mathsf{nk}`.
- Split :math:`R` into two 32-byte sequences, :math:`\mathsf{dk_{internal}}` and :math:`\mathsf{ovk_{internal}}`.
- Return the internal full viewing key as :math:`(\mathsf{ak}, \mathsf{nk_{internal}}, \mathsf{ovk_{internal}}, \mathsf{dk_{internal}})`.

This design uses the same technique as non-hardened derivation to obtain a full viewing key
with the same spend authority (the private key corresponding to :math:`\mathsf{ak}`) as the
original, but viewing authority only for internal transfers.

The values of :math:`I`, :math:`I_\mathsf{nsk}`, and :math:`R` are the same between deriving
a full viewing key, and deriving the corresponding spending key. Both of these derivations
are shown in the following diagram:

(For simplicity, the proof authorizing key is not shown.)

This method of deriving internal keys is applied to external keys that are children of the
Account level. It was implemented in `zcashd` as part of support for ZIP 316 [#zip-0316]_.

Note that the internal extended key is invalid if :math:`\mathsf{ak}` is the zero point of Jubjub,
or if the corresponding :math:`\mathsf{ivk_{internal}}` derived from the internal full viewing key
as specified in [#protocol-saplingkeycomponents]_ is :math:`0`.


Sapling diversifier derivation
------------------------------

The 88-bit diversifiers for a Sapling extended key are derived from its diversifier key :math:`\mathsf{dk}`.
To prevent the diversifier leaking how many diversified addresses have already been generated for an account,
we make the sequence of diversifiers pseudorandom and uncorrelated to that of any other account. In order to
reach the maximum possible diversifier range without running into repetitions due to the birthday bound, we
use FF1-AES256 as a Pseudo-Random Permutation as follows:

- Let :math:`j` be the index of the desired diversifier, in the range :math:`0\,.\!. 2^{88} - 1`.
- :math:`d_j = \mathsf{FF1}\text{-}\mathsf{AES256.Encrypt}(\mathsf{dk}, \texttt{“”}, \mathsf{I2LEBSP}_{88}(j))`.

A valid diversifier :math:`d_j` is one for which :math:`\mathsf{DiversifyHash^{Sapling}}(d_j) \neq \bot`.
For a given :math:`\mathsf{dk}`, approximately half of the possible values of :math:`j` yield valid
diversifiers.

The default diversifier for a Sapling extended key is defined to be :math:`d_j`, where :math:`j` is the
least nonnegative integer yielding a valid diversifier.


Specification: Orchard key derivation
=====================================

The derivation mechanism for Sapling addresses specified above incurs significant complexity to support
non-hardened derivation. In the several years since Sapling was deployed, we have seen no use cases for
non-hardened derivation appear. With that in mind, we only support hardened key derivation for Orchard.

Orchard extended keys
---------------------

We represent an Orchard extended spending key as :math:`(\mathsf{sk, c}),` where :math:`\mathsf{sk}`
is the normal Orchard spending key (opaque 32 bytes), and :math:`\mathsf{c}` is the chain code.

Orchard master key generation
-----------------------------

Let :math:`S` be a seed byte sequence of a chosen length, which MUST be at least 32 and at most 252 bytes.

- Calculate :math:`I = \mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{512}(\texttt{“ZcashIP32Orchard”}, S)`.
- Split :math:`I` into two 32-byte sequences, :math:`I_L` and :math:`I_R`.
- Use :math:`I_L` as the master spending key :math:`\mathsf{sk}_m`.
- Use :math:`I_R` as the master chain code :math:`\mathsf{c}_m`.
- Return :math:`(\mathsf{sk}_m, \mathsf{c}_m)` as the master extended spending key
  :math:`m_\mathsf{Orchard}`.

Orchard child key derivation
----------------------------

:math:`\mathsf{CDKsk}((\mathsf{sk}_{par}, \mathsf{c}_{par}), i)`:math:`\rightarrow (\mathsf{sk}_{i}, \mathsf{c}_i)`

- Check whether :math:`i \geq 2^{31}` (whether the child is a hardened key).

  - If so (hardened child): let
    :math:`I = \mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(\mathsf{c}_{par}, [\texttt{0x81}]\,||\,\mathsf{sk}_{par}\,||\,\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{32}(i))`.
  - If not (normal child): return failure.

- Split :math:`I` into two 32-byte sequences, :math:`I_L` and :math:`I_R`.
- Use :math:`I_L` as the child spending key :math:`\mathsf{sk}_{i}`.
- Use :math:`I_R` as the child chain code :math:`\mathsf{c}_i`.

Note that the resulting child spending key may produce an invalid external FVK, as specified
in [#protocol-orchardkeycomponents]_, with small probability. The corresponding internal FVK
derived as specified in the next section may also be invalid with small probability.

Orchard internal key derivation
-------------------------------

As in the case of Sapling, for a given external address, we want to produce another address
for use by wallets for internal operations such as change and auto-shielding. That is, for
any external full viewing key we need to be able to derive a single internal full viewing
key that has viewing authority for just internal transfers. We also need to be able to
derive the corresponding internal spending key if we have the external spending key.

Let :math:`\mathsf{ask}` be the spend authorizing key if available, and
let :math:`(\mathsf{ak}, \mathsf{nk}, \mathsf{rivk})` be the corresponding external full
viewing key, obtained as specified in [#protocol-orchardkeycomponents]_.

Define :math:`\mathsf{DeriveInternalFVK^{Orchard}}(\mathsf{ak}, \mathsf{nk}, \mathsf{rivk})`
as follows:

- Let :math:`K = \mathsf{I2LEBSP}_{256}(\mathsf{rivk})`.
- Let :math:`\mathsf{rivk_{internal}} = \mathsf{ToScalar^{Orchard}}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(K, [\mathtt{0x83}] \,||\, \mathsf{I2LEOSP_{256}}(\mathsf{ak}) \,||\, \mathsf{I2LEOSP_{256}}(\mathsf{nk}))`.
- Return :math:`(\mathsf{ak}, \mathsf{nk}, \mathsf{rivk_{internal}})`.

The result of applying :math:`\mathsf{DeriveInternalFVK^{Orchard}}` to the external full viewing
key is the internal full viewing key. The corresponding expanded internal spending key is
:math:`(\mathsf{ask}, \mathsf{nk}, \mathsf{rivk_{internal}})`,

Unlike `Sapling internal key derivation`_, we do not base this internal key derivation
procedure on non-hardened derivation, which is not defined for Orchard. We can obtain the
desired separation of viewing authority by modifying only the :math:`\mathsf{rivk_{internal}}`
field relative to the external full viewing key, which results in different
:math:`\mathsf{dk_{internal}}`, :math:`\mathsf{ivk_{internal}}` and :math:`\mathsf{ovk_{internal}}`
fields being derived, as specified in [#protocol-orchardkeycomponents]_ and shown in the following
diagram:

    :width: 720px
    :align: center
    :figclass: align-center

    Diagram of Orchard internal key derivation, also showing derivation from the parent extended spending key

This method of deriving internal keys is applied to external keys that are children of the
Account level. It was implemented in `zcashd` as part of support for ZIP 316 [#zip-0316]_.

Note that the resulting FVK may be invalid, as specified in [#protocol-orchardkeycomponents]_.

Orchard diversifier derivation
------------------------------

As with Sapling, we define a mechanism for deterministically deriving a sequence of diversifiers, without
leaking how many diversified addresses have already been generated for an account. Unlike Sapling, we do so
by deriving a diversifier key directly from the full viewing key, instead of as part of the extended spending
key. This means that the full viewing key provides the capability to determine the position of a diversifier
within the sequence, which matches the capabilities of a Sapling extended full viewing key but simplifies the
key structure.

Given an Orchard extended spending key :math:`(\mathsf{sk}_i, \mathsf{c}_i)`:

- Let :math:`(\mathsf{ak}, \mathsf{nk}, \mathsf{rivk})` be the Orchard full viewing key for :math:`\mathsf{sk}_i`.
- Let :math:`K = \mathsf{I2LEBSP}_{256}(\mathsf{rivk})` and let :math:`B = \mathsf{repr}_{\mathbb{P}}(\mathsf{ak})\,||\,\mathsf{I2LEBSP}_{256}(\mathsf{nk})`.
- :math:`\mathsf{dk}_i = \mathsf{truncate}_{32}(\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}(K, [\texttt{0x82}]\,||\,\mathsf{LEBS2OSP}_{512}(B)))`.
- Let :math:`j` be the index of the desired diversifier, in the range :math:`0\,.\!. 2^{88} - 1`.
- :math:`d_{i,j} = \mathsf{FF1}\text{-}\mathsf{AES256.Encrypt}(\mathsf{dk}_i, \texttt{“”}, \mathsf{I2LEBSP}_{88}(j))`.

Note that unlike Sapling, all Orchard diversifiers are valid, and thus all possible values of :math:`j` yield
valid diversifiers.

The default diversifier for :math:`(\mathsf{sk}_i, \mathsf{c}_i)` is defined to be :math:`d_{i,0}.`


Specification: Wallet usage
===========================

Existing Zcash-supporting HD wallets all use BIP 44 [#bip-0044]_ to organize their derived keys. In order to
more easily mesh with existing user experiences, we broadly follow BIP 44's design here. However, we have
altered the design where it makes sense to leverage features of shielded addresses.

Key path levels
---------------

Sapling and Orchard key paths have the following three path levels at the top, all of which use hardened
derivation:

- :math:`purpose`: a constant set to :math:`32'` (or :math:`\texttt{0x80000020}`) following the BIP 43
  recommendation. It indicates that the subtree of this node is used according to this specification.

- :math:`coin\_type`: a constant identifying the cryptocurrency that this subtree's keys are used with. For
  compatibility with existing BIP 44 implementations, we use the same constants as defined in SLIP 44
  [#slip-0044]_. Note that in keeping with that document, all cryptocurrency testnets share :math:`coin\_type`
  index :math:`1`.

- :math:`account`: numbered from index :math:`0` in sequentially increasing manner. Defined as in
  BIP 44 [#bip-0044]_.

Unlike BIP 44, none of the shielded key paths have a :math:`change` path level. The use of change addresses
in Bitcoin is a (failed) attempt to increase the difficulty of tracking users on the transaction graph, by
segregating external and internal address usage. Shielded addresses are never publicly visible in
transactions, which means that sending change back to the originating address is indistinguishable from
using a change address.

Sapling key path
----------------

Sapling provides a mechanism to allow the efficient creation of diversified payment addresses with the same
spending authority. A group of such addresses shares the same full viewing key and incoming viewing key, and
so creating as many unlinkable addresses as needed does not increase the cost of scanning the block chain for
relevant transactions.

The above key path levels include an account identifier, which in all user interfaces is represented as a
"bucket of funds" under the control of a single spending authority. Therefore, wallets implementing Sapling
ZIP 32 derivation MUST support the following path for any account in range :math:`\{ 0\,.\!. 2^{31} - 1 \}`:

* :math:`m_\mathsf{Sapling} / purpose' / coin\_type' / account'`.

Furthermore, wallets MUST support generating the default payment address (corresponding to the default
diversifier as defined above) for any account they support. They MAY also support generating a stream of
payment addresses for a given account, if they wish to maintain the user experience of giving a unique
address to each recipient.

Note that a given account can have a maximum of approximately :math:`2^{87}` payment addresses, because each
diversifier has around a 50% chance of being invalid.

If in certain circumstances a wallet needs to derive independent spend authorities within a single account,
they MAY additionally support a non-hardened :math:`address\_index` path level as in [#bip-0044]_:

* :math:`m_\mathsf{Sapling} / purpose' / coin\_type' / account' / address\_index`.

`zcashd` version 4.6.0 and later uses this to derive "legacy" Sapling addresses from a mnemonic seed phrase
under account :math:`\mathtt{0x7FFFFFFF}`, using hardened derivation for :math:`address\_index`.

Orchard key path
----------------

Orchard supports diversified addresses with the same spending authority (like Sapling). A group of such
addresses shares the same full viewing key and incoming viewing key, and so creating as many unlinkable
addresses as needed does not increase the cost of scanning the block chain for relevant transactions.

The above key path levels include an account identifier, which in all user interfaces is represented as a
"bucket of funds" under the control of a single spending authority. Therefore, wallets implementing Orchard
ZIP 32 derivation MUST support the following path for any account in range :math:`\{ 0\,.\!. 2^{31} - 1 \}`:

* :math:`m_\mathsf{Orchard} / purpose' / coin\_type' / account'`.

Furthermore, wallets MUST support generating the default payment address (corresponding to the default
diversifier for Orchard) for any account they support. They MAY also support generating a stream of
diversified payment addresses for a given account, if they wish to enable users to give a unique address to
each recipient.

Note that a given account can have a maximum of :math:`2^{88}` payment addresses (unlike Sapling, all Orchard
diversifiers are valid).

Account discovery
-----------------

A wallet that imports a master seed from an external source SHOULD attempt to discover accounts in the
following manner.

Let :math:`M` be the subset of :math:`\{ m_\mathsf{Sapling}, m_\mathsf{Orchard} \}` corresponding to master keys
for address types that this wallet supports.

* For each account index starting from :math:`account = 0`:

  * For :math:`m \in M`:

    1. Derive the external full viewing key of the account at path :math:`m / purpose' / coin\_type' / account'`.
    2. Scan for transactions sending to this account using the algorithm in [#protocol-scan]_.

  If no transactions are found for either Sapling or Orchard at a given account index, break from the loop
  over :math:`account`.

* If the wallet supports Sapling addresses, then for each address index starting from :math:`address\_index = 0`:

  1. Derive the external full viewing key of the Sapling address at path :math:`m_{Sapling} / purpose' / coin\_type' / \mathtt{0x7FFFFFFF}' / address\_index`.
  2. Scan for transactions sending to this address using the algorithm in [#protocol-scan]_.

  If no transactions are found for a range of (`Legacy address gap limit`_) consecutive addresses, break
  from the loop over :math:`address\_index`.

(The loop over :math:`address\_index` finds legacy Sapling addresses generated by `zcashd`.)

This algorithm is successful because wallets SHOULD disallow creation of new accounts if the previous one
has no transaction history, as described in `Key path levels`_ above.

Please note that the algorithm works with the transaction history, not account balances, so you can have
an account with zero balance and the algorithm will still continue with discovery.

Legacy address gap limit
````````````````````````

The RECOMMENDED address gap limit for legacy Sapling addresses is 20. If a wallet hits this number of unused
addresses in a row, it expects there to be no used addresses beyond this point and SHOULD stop searching
the legacy Sapling address chain. We scan just the external chains, because internal chains receive only
coins that come from the associated external chains.

Wallet software should warn when the user is trying to exceed the gap limit on an external chain by
generating a new address.


Specification: Fingerprints and Tags
====================================

Sapling Full Viewing Key Fingerprints and Tags
----------------------------------------------

A "Sapling full viewing key fingerprint" of a full viewing key with raw encoding :math:`\mathit{FVK}` (as specified
in [#protocol-saplingfullviewingkeyencoding]_) is given by:

* :math:`\mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{256}(\texttt{“ZcashSaplingFVFP”}, \mathit{FVK})`.

It MAY be used to uniquely identify a particular Sapling full viewing key.

A "Sapling full viewing key tag" is the first 4 bytes of the corresponding Sapling full viewing key
fingerprint. It is intended for optimizing performance of key lookups, and MUST NOT be assumed to
uniquely identify a particular key.

Orchard Full Viewing Key Fingerprints and Tags
----------------------------------------------

An "Orchard full viewing key fingerprint" of a full viewing key with raw encoding :math:`\mathit{FVK}` (as
specified in [#protocol-orchardfullviewingkeyencoding]_) is given by:

* :math:`\mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{256}(\texttt{“ZcashOrchardFVFP”}, \mathit{FVK})`.

It MAY be used to uniquely identify a particular Orchard full viewing key.

An "Orchard full viewing key tag" is the first 4 bytes of the corresponding Orchard full viewing key
fingerprint. It is intended for optimizing performance of key lookups, and MUST NOT be assumed to
uniquely identify a particular key.

Seed Fingerprints
-----------------

A "seed fingerprint" for the master seed :math:`S` of a hierarchical deterministic wallet is given by:

* :math:`\mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{256}(\texttt{“Zcash_HD_Seed_FP”},`:math:`[\mathsf{length}(S)]\,||\,S)`.

It MAY be used to uniquely identify a particular hierarchical deterministic wallet.

No corresponding short tag is defined.

Note: a previous version of this specification did not have the length byte prefixing the seed.
The current specification reflects the implementation in `zcashd`.


Specification: Key Encodings
============================

The following encodings are analogous to the ``xprv`` and ``xpub`` encodings defined
in BIP 32 for transparent keys and addresses. Each key type has a raw representation
and a Bech32 [#bip-0173]_ encoding.


Sapling extended spending keys
------------------------------

A Sapling extended spending key :math:`(\mathsf{ask, nsk, ovk, dk, c})`, at depth :math:`depth`,
with parent full viewing key tag :math:`parent\_fvk\_tag` and child number :math:`i`, is
represented as a byte sequence:

* :math:`\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{8}(depth)`:math:`||\,parent\_fvk\_tag`:math:`||\,\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{32}(i)`:math:`||\,\mathsf{c}`:math:`||\,\mathsf{EncodeExtSKParts}(\mathsf{ask, nsk, ovk, dk})`.

For the master extended spending key, :math:`depth` is :math:`0`, :math:`parent\_fvk\_tag` is
4 zero bytes, and :math:`i` is :math:`0`.

When encoded as Bech32, the Human-Readable Part is ``secret-extended-key-main``
for the production network, or ``secret-extended-key-test`` for the test network.

Sapling extended full viewing keys
----------------------------------

A Sapling extended full viewing key :math:`(\mathsf{ak, nk, ovk, dk, c})`, at depth :math:`depth`,
with parent full viewing key tag :math:`parent\_fvk\_tag` and child number :math:`i`, is
represented as a byte sequence:

* :math:`\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{8}(depth)`:math:`||\,parent\_fvk\_tag`:math:`||\,\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{32}(i)`:math:`||\,\mathsf{c}`:math:`||\,\mathsf{EncodeExtFVKParts}(\mathsf{ak, nk, ovk, dk})`.

For the master extended full viewing key, :math:`depth` is :math:`0`, :math:`parent\_fvk\_tag`
is 4 zero bytes, and :math:`i` is :math:`0`.

When encoded as Bech32, the Human-Readable Part is ``zxviews`` for the production
network, or ``zxviewtestsapling`` for the test network.

Orchard extended spending keys
------------------------------

An Orchard extended spending key :math:`(\mathsf{sk, c})`, at depth :math:`depth`, with parent full viewing
key tag :math:`parent\_fvk\_tag` and child number :math:`i`, is represented as a byte sequence:

* :math:`\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{8}(depth)\,||\,parent\_fvk\_tag\,||\,\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{32}(i)\,||\,\mathsf{c}\,||\,\mathsf{sk}`.

For the master extended spending key, :math:`depth` is :math:`0`, :math:`parent\_fvk\_tag` is
4 zero bytes, and :math:`i` is :math:`0`.

When encoded as Bech32, the Human-Readable Part is ``secret-orchard-extsk-main``
for Mainnet, or ``secret-orchard-extsk-test`` for Testnet.

We define this encoding for completeness, however given that it includes the capability to derive child
spending keys, we expect that most wallets will only expose the regular Orchard spending key encoding to
users [#protocol-orchardspendingkeyencoding]_.


Values reserved due to previous specification for Sprout
========================================================

The following values were previously used in the specification of hierarchical derivation
for Sprout, and therefore SHOULD NOT be used in future Zcash-related specifications:

* the :math:`\mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{512}` personalization :math:`\texttt{“ZcashIP32_Sprout”}`,
  formerly specified for derivation of the master key of the Sprout tree;
* the :math:`\mathsf{BLAKE2b}\text{-}\mathsf{256}` personalization :math:`\texttt{“Zcash_Sprout_AFP”}`,
  formerly specified for generation of Sprout address fingerprints;
* the :math:`\mathsf{PRF^{expand}}` prefix :math:`\texttt{0x80}`, formerly specified for
  Sprout child key derivation;
* the Bech32 Human-Readable Parts ``zxsprout`` and ``zxtestsprout``, formerly specified for
  Sprout extended spending keys on Mainnet and Testnet respectively.

            <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <a id="footnote-reference-1" class="footnote_reference" href="#bcp14">1</a> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.</p>
            <p>The terms below are to be interpreted as follows:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Recipient</dt>
                <dd>A wallet or other software that can receive transfers of assets (such as ZEC) or in the future potentially other transaction-based state changes.</dd>
                <dt>Producer</dt>
                <dd>A wallet or other software that can create an Address (in which case it is normally also a Recipient) or a Viewing Key.</dd>
                <dt>Consumer</dt>
                <dd>A wallet or other software that can make use of an Address or Viewing Key that it is given.</dd>
                <dt>Sender</dt>
                <dd>A wallet or other software that can send transfers of assets, or other consensus state side-effects defined in future. Senders are a subset of Consumers.</dd>
                <dt>Receiver</dt>
                <dd>The necessary information to transfer an asset to a Recipient that generated that Receiver using a specific Transfer Protocol. Each Receiver is associated unambiguously with a specific Receiver Type, identified by an integer Typecode.</dd>
                <dt>Receiver Encoding</dt>
                <dd>An encoding of a Receiver as a byte sequence.</dd>
                <dt>Viewing Key</dt>
                <dd>The necessary information to view information about payments to an Address, or (in the case of a Full Viewing Key) from an Address. An Incoming Viewing Key can be derived from a Full Viewing Key, and an Address can be derived from an Incoming Viewing Key.</dd>
                <dt>Viewing Key Encoding</dt>
                <dd>An encoding of a Viewing Key as a byte sequence.</dd>
                <dt>Metadata Encoding</dt>
                <dd>An encoding of metadata that is not a Receiver or Viewing Key, but may affect the interpretation of the overall Unified Address/Viewing Key.</dd>

                <dd>Either a Legacy Address or a Unified Address.</dd>
                <dt>Transfer Protocol</dt>
                <dd>A specification of how a Sender can transfer assets to a Recipient. For example, the Transfer Protocol for a Sapling Receiver is the subset of the Zcash protocol required to successfully transfer ZEC using Sapling Spend/Output Transfers as specified in the Zcash Protocol Specification. (A single Zcash transaction can contain transfers of multiple Transfer Protocols. For example a t→z transaction that shields to the Sapling pool requires both Transparent and Sapling Transfer Protocols.)</dd>
                <dt>Unified String Encoding</dt>
                <dd>An encoding of a UA/UVK as a US-ASCII string, intended either for display and transfer by Zcash end-users, or internal use by Zcash-related software.</dd>
                <dt>Unified QR Encoding</dt>
                <dd>An encoding of a UA/UVK as a QR code, intended for display and transfer by Zcash end-users in situations where usability advantages of a 2D bar code may be relevant.</dd>
                <dt>Address Encoding</dt>
                <dd>The externally visible encoding of an Address (e.g. as a string of characters or a QR code).</dd>

                <dd>An integer representing a UTC time in seconds relative to the Unix Epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.</dd>

            <p>This proposal defines Unified Addresses, which bundle together Zcash Addresses of different types in a way that can be presented as a single Address Encoding. It also defines Unified Viewing Keys, which perform a similar function for Zcash viewing keys.</p>

            <p>Up to and including the Canopy network upgrade, Zcash supported the following Payment Address types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Transparent Addresses (P2PKH and P2SH)</li>
                <li>Sprout Addresses</li>
                <li>Sapling Addresses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these has its own Address Encodings, as a string and as a QR code. (Since the QR code is derivable from the string encoding as described in <a id="footnote-reference-3" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-addressandkeyencoding">9</a>, for many purposes it suffices to consider the string encoding.)</p>
            <p>The Orchard proposal <a id="footnote-reference-4" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0224">26</a> adds a new Address type, Orchard Addresses.</p>
            <p>The difficulty with defining new Address Encodings for each Address type, is that end-users are forced to be aware of the various types, and in particular which types are supported by a given Consumer or Recipient. In order to make sure that transfers are completed successfully, users may be forced to explicitly generate Addresses of different types and re-distribute encodings of them, which adds significant friction and cognitive overhead to understanding and using Zcash.</p>
            <p>The goals for a Unified Address standard are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simplify coordination between Recipients and Consumers by removing complexity from negotiating Address types.</li>
                <li>Provide a “bridging mechanism” to allow shielded wallets to successfully interact with conformant Transparent-Only wallets.</li>
                <li>Allow older conformant wallets to interact seamlessly with newer wallets.</li>
                <li>Enable users of newer wallets to upgrade to newer transaction technologies and/or pools while maintaining seamless interactions with counterparties using older wallets.</li>
                <li>Facilitate wallets to assume more sophisticated responsibilities for shielding and/or migrating user funds.</li>
                <li>Allow wallets to potentially develop new transfer mechanisms without underlying protocol changes.</li>
                <li>Support abstractions corresponding to a Unified Address that provide the functionality of Full Viewing Keys and Incoming Viewing Keys.</li>
                <li>Provide forward compatibility that is standard for all wallets across a range of potential future features. Some examples might include Layer 2 features, cross-chain interoperability and bridging, and decentralized exchange.</li>
                <li>Allow for Metadata Items to be included in Unified Addresses/Viewing Keys in order to provide future extensibility.</li>
                <li>The standard should work well for Zcash today and upcoming potential upgrades, and also anticipate even broader use cases down the road such as cross-chain functionality.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>Unified Addresses specify multiple methods for payment to a Recipient's wallet. The Sender's wallet can then non-interactively select the method of payment.</p>
                <p>Importantly, any wallet can support Unified Addresses, even when that wallet only supports a subset of payment methods for receiving and/or sending.</p>
                <p>Despite having some similar characteristics, the Unified Address standard is orthogonal to Payment Request URIs <a id="footnote-reference-5" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0321">29</a> and similar schemes. Since Payment Requests encode addresses as alphanumeric strings, no change to ZIP 321 is required in order to use Unified Addresses in Payment Requests.</p>

                <p>Wallets follow a model <em>Interaction Flow</em> as follows:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>A Producer <em>generates</em> an Address.</li>
                    <li>The Producer <em>encodes</em> the Address.</li>
                    <li>The Producer wallet or human user <em>distributes</em> this Address Encoding. This ZIP leaves distribution mechanisms out of scope.</li>
                    <li>A Consumer wallet or user <em>imports</em> the Address Encoding through any of a variety of mechanisms (QR code scanning, Payment URIs, cut-and-paste, or “in-band” protocols like <code>Reply-To</code> memos).</li>
                    <li>A Consumer wallet <em>decodes</em> the Address Encoding and performs validity checks.</li>
                    <li>(Perhaps later in time) if the Consumer wallet is a Sender, it can execute a transfer of ZEC (or other assets or protocol state changes) to the Address.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Encodings of the same Address may be distributed zero or more times through different means. Zero or more Consumers may import Addresses. Zero or more of those (that are Senders) may execute a Transfer. A single Sender may execute multiple Transfers over time from a single import.</p>
                <p>Steps 1 to 5 inclusive also apply to Interaction Flows for Unified Full Viewing Keys and Unified Incoming Viewing Keys.</p>

                <p>A Unified Address (or UA for short) combines one or more Receivers.</p>
                <p>When new Transport Protocols are introduced to the Zcash protocol after Unified Addresses are standardized, those should introduce new Receiver Types but <em>not</em> different Address types outside of the UA standard. There needs to be a compelling reason to deviate from the standard, since the benefits of UA come precisely from their applicability across all new protocol upgrades.</p>

                <p>Every wallet must properly <em>parse</em> encodings of a Unified Address or Unified Viewing Key containing unrecognised Items.</p>

                <p>The Unified String Encoding is “opaque” to human readers: it does <em>not</em> allow visual identification of which Receivers or Receiver Types are present.</p>
                <p>The Unified String Encoding is resilient against typos, transcription errors, cut-and-paste errors, truncation, or other likely UX hazards.</p>
                <p>There is a well-defined Unified QR Encoding of a Unified Address (or UFVK or UIVK) as a QR code, which produces QR codes that are reasonably compact and robust.</p>
                <p>There is a well-defined transformation between the Unified QR Encoding and Unified String Encoding of a given UA/UVK in either direction.</p>
                <p>The Unified String Encoding fits into ZIP-321 Payment URIs <a id="footnote-reference-6" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0321">29</a> and general URIs without introducing parse ambiguities.</p>
                <p>The encoding must support sufficiently many Recipient Types to allow for reasonable future expansion.</p>
                <p>The encoding must allow all wallets to safely and correctly parse out unrecognised Receiver Types well enough to ignore them.</p>

                <p>When executing a Transfer the Sender selects a Receiver via a Selection process.</p>
                <p>Given a valid UA, Selection must treat any unrecognised Item as though it were absent.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This property is crucial for forward compatibility to ensure users who upgrade to newer protocols / UAs don't lose the ability to smoothly interact with older wallets.</li>
                    <li>This property is crucial for allowing Transparent-Only UA-Conformant wallets to interact with newer shielded wallets, removing a disincentive for adopting newer shielded wallets.</li>
                    <li>This property also allows Transparent-Only wallets to upgrade to shielded support without re-acquiring counterparty UAs. If they are re-acquired, the user flow and usability will be minimally disrupted.</li>

                <p>Unified Addresses and Unified Viewing Keys must be able to include Receivers and Viewing Keys of experimental types, possibly alongside non-experimental ones.

                <p>A Unified Full Viewing Key (resp. Unified Incoming Viewing Key) can be used in a similar way to a Full Viewing Key (resp. Incoming Viewing Key) as described in the Zcash Protocol Specification <a id="footnote-reference-7" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol">2</a>.</p>
                <p>For a Transparent P2PKH Address that is derived according to BIP 32 <a id="footnote-reference-8" class="footnote_reference" href="#bip-0032">30</a> and BIP 44 <a id="footnote-reference-9" class="footnote_reference" href="#bip-0044">33</a>, the nearest equivalent to a Full Viewing Key or Incoming Viewing Key for a given BIP 44 account is an extended public key, as defined in the section “Extended keys” of BIP 32. Therefore, UFVKs and UIVKs should be able to include such extended public keys.</p>
                <p>A wallet should support deriving a UIVK from a UFVK, and a Unified Address from a UIVK.</p>

                <p>Rather than defining a Bech32 string encoding of Orchard Shielded Payment Addresses, we instead define a Unified Address format that is able to encode a set of Receivers of different types. This enables the Consumer of a Unified Address to choose the Receiver of the best type it supports, providing a better user experience as new Receiver Types are added in the future.</p>
                <p>Assume that we are given a set of one or more Receiver Encodings for distinct types. That is, the set may optionally contain one Receiver of each of the Receiver Types in the following fixed Priority List:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typecode

                 item MUST be an unsigned 32-bit integer in little-endian order specifying the Address Expiry Height, a block height of the Zcash chain associated with the UA/UVK. A Unified Address containing metadata Typecode
                    <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0xE0}\)</span>
                 MUST be considered expired when the height of the Zcash chain is greater than this value.</p>

                 MUST be considered expired when the current time is after the Address Expiry Time.</p>
                <p>A Sender that supports <a href="#revision-1">Revision 1</a> of this specification MUST set a non-zero <code>nExpiryHeight</code> field in transactions it creates that are sent to a Unified Address that defines an Address Expiry Height. If the <code>nExpiryHeight</code> normally constructed by the Sender would be greater than the Address Expiry Height, then the transaction MUST NOT be sent. If only an Address Expiry Time is specified, then the Sender SHOULD choose a value for <code>nExpiryHeight</code> such that the transaction will expire no more than 24 hours after the current time. If both
                    <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0xE0}\)</span>
                 and
                    <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0xE1}\)</span>
                 Metadata Items are present, then both restrictions apply.</p>
                <p>If a Sender sends to multiple Unified Addresses in the same transaction, then all of the Address Expiry constraints imposed by the individual addresses apply.</p>
                <p>If a wallet user attempts to send to an expired address, the error presented to the user by the wallet SHOULD include a suggestion that the user should attempt to obtain a currently-valid address for the intended recipient. A wallet MUST NOT send to an address that it knows to have expired.</p>
                <p>Address expiration imposes no constraints on the Producer of an address. A Producer MAY generate multiple Unified Addresses with the same Receivers but different expiration metadata and/or any number of distinct Diversified Unified Addresses with the same or different expiry metadata, in any combination. Note that although changes to metadata will result in a visually distinct address, such updated addresses will be directly linkable to the original addresses because they share the same Receivers.</p>
                <p>When deriving a UIVK from a UFVK containing Typecodes

                    <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0xE0}\)</span>

                <p>Producers of Diversified Unified Addresses should be aware that the expiration metadata could potentially be used to link addresses from the same source. Normally, if Diversified Unified Addresses derived from the same UIVK contain only Sapling and/or Orchard Receivers and no Metadata Items, they will be unlinkable as described in <a id="footnote-reference-26" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-concretediversifyhash">8</a>; this property does not hold when Metadata Items are present. It is RECOMMENDED that when deriving Unified Addresses from a UFVK or UIVK containing expiry metadata that the Expiry Height and Expiry Time of each distinct address vary from one another, so as to reduce the likelihood that addresses may be linked via their expiry metadata.</p>
                <section id="rationale"><h4><span class="section-heading">Rationale</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#rationale"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h4>
                    <p>The intent of this specification is that Consumers of Unified Addresses must not send to expired addresses. If only an Address Expiry Time is specified, a transaction to the associated address could be mined after the Address Expiry Time within a 24-hour window.</p>
                    <p>The reason that the transaction MUST NOT be sent when its <code>nExpiryHeight</code> as normally constructed is greater than the Address Expiry Height is to avoid unnecessary information leakage in that field about which address was used as the destination. If a sender were to instead use the expiry height to directly set the <code>nExpiryHeight</code> field, this would leak the expiry information of the destination address, which may then be identifiable.</p>
                    <p>When honoring an Address Expiry Time, the reason that a sender SHOULD choose a <code>nExpiryHeight</code> that is expected to occur within 24 hours of the time of transaction construction is to, when possible, ensure that the expiry time is respected to within a day. Address Expiry Times are advisory and do not represent hard bounds because computer clocks often disagree, but every effort should be made to ensure that transactions expire instead of being mined more than 24 hours after a recipient address's expiry time. When chain height information is available to the Sender, it is both permissible and advisable to set this bound more tightly; a common expiry delta used by many wallets is 40 blocks from the current chain tip, as suggested in ZIP 203 <a id="footnote-reference-27" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0203-default-expiry">24</a>.</p>

                <p>In addition to external addresses suitable for giving out to Senders, a wallet typically requires addresses for internal operations such as change and auto-shielding.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>For shielded keys, these properties are achieved by the one-wayness of

                <p>Since an external P2PKH FVK encodes the chain code and public key at the Account level, we can derive both external and internal child keys from it, as described in BIP 44 <a id="footnote-reference-31" class="footnote_reference" href="#bip-0044-path-change">34</a>. It is possible to derive an internal P2PKH FVK from the external P2PKH FVK (i.e. its parent) without having the external spending key, because child derivation at the Change level is non-hardened.</p>

                <p>When a Sender constructs a transaction that creates Sapling or Orchard notes, it uses an outgoing viewing key, as described in <a id="footnote-reference-40" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-saplingsend">6</a> and <a id="footnote-reference-41" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-orchardsend">7</a>, to encrypt an outgoing ciphertext. Decryption with the outgoing viewing key allows recovering the sent note plaintext, including destination address, amount, and memo. The intention is that this outgoing viewing key should be associated with the source of the funds.</p>
                <p>However, the specification of which outgoing viewing key should be used is left somewhat open in <a id="footnote-reference-42" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-saplingsend">6</a> and <a id="footnote-reference-43" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-orchardsend">7</a>; in particular, it was unclear whether transfers should be considered as being sent from an address, or from a ZIP 32 account <a id="footnote-reference-44" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0032-specification-wallet-usage">21</a>. The adoption of multiple shielded protocols that support outgoing viewing keys (i.e. Sapling and Orchard) further complicates this question, since from NU5 activation, nothing at the consensus level prevents a wallet from spending both Sapling and Orchard notes in the same transaction.

                <p>Here we refine the protocol specification in order to allow more precise determination of viewing authority for UFVKs.</p>
                <p>A Sender will attempt to determine a "sending Account" for each transfer. The preferred approach is for the API used to perform a transfer to directly specify a sending Account. Otherwise, if the Sender can ascertain that all funds used in the transfer are from addresses associated with some Account, then it SHOULD treat that as the sending Account. If not, then the sending Account is undetermined.</p>
                <p>The Sender also determines a "preferred sending protocol" —one of "transparent", "Sapling", or "Orchard"— corresponding to the most preferred Receiver Type (as given in <a href="#encoding-of-unified-addresses">Encoding of Unified Addresses</a>) of any funds sent in the transaction.</p>
                <p>If the sending Account has been determined, then the Sender SHOULD use the external or internal
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{ovk}\)</span>
                 (according to the type of transfer), as specified by the preferred sending protocol, of the full viewing key for that Account (i.e. at the ZIP 32 Account level).</p>
                <p>If the sending Account is undetermined, then the Sender SHOULD choose one of the addresses, restricted to addresses for the preferred sending protocol, from which funds are being sent (for example, the first one for that protocol), and then use the external or internal
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{ovk}\)</span>

                    <p>There is a generic brute force attack against near second preimage resistance. The adversary generates UAs / UVKs at random with known keys, until one has an encoding that partially collides with one of the

                     targets. It may be possible to improve on this attack by making use of properties of checksums, etc.</p>
                    <p>The generic attack puts an upper bound on the achievable security: if it takes work

                     to produce and verify a UA/UVK, and the size of the character set is

                    <p>There is also a generic brute force attack against nonmalleability. The adversary modifies the target UA/UVK slightly and computes the corresponding decoding, then repeats until the decoding is valid and also useful to the adversary (e.g. it would lead to the Sender using a Transparent Address).

                    <p>It would be possible to make an attack more expensive by making the work done by a Producer more expensive. (This wouldn't necessarily have to increase the work done by the Consumer.) However, given that Unified Addresses may need to be produced on constrained computing platforms, this was not considered to be beneficial overall.</p>
                    <p>The padding contains the HRP so that the HRP has the same protection against malleation as the rest of the address. This may help against cross-network attacks, or attacks that confuse addresses with viewing keys.</p>

                    <p>The cost is dominated by 4 BLAKE2b compressions for

                     bytes. A UA containing a Transparent Address, a Sapling Address, and an Orchard Address, would have

                     bytes. The restriction to a single Address with a given Typecode (and at most one Transparent Address) means that this is also the maximum length of a Unified Address containing only defined Receiver Types as of NU5 activation.</p>
                    <p>For longer UAs (when other Receiver Types are added) or UVKs, the cost increases to 6 BLAKE2b compressions for
                        <span class="math">\(128 &lt; \ell_M \leq 192,\)</span>
                     and 10 BLAKE2b compressions for
                        <span class="math">\(192 &lt; \ell_M \leq 256,\)</span>
                     for example. The maximum cost for which the algorithm is defined would be 196608 BLAKE2b compressions at
                        <span class="math">\(\ell_M = \ell^\mathsf{MAX}_M\)</span>
                     bytes.</p>
                    <p>A naïve implementation of the

                        <span class="math">\(\ell_M\)</span>
                     bytes plus the size of a BLAKE2b hash state. However, it is possible to reduce this by streaming the
                        <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
                     part of the jumbled encoding three times from a less memory-constrained device. It is essential that the streamed value of
                        <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
                     is the same on each pass, which can be verified using a Message Authentication Code (with key held only by the Consumer) or collision-resistant hash function. After the first pass of
                        <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
                    , the implementation is able to compute
                        <span class="math">\(y;\)</span>
                     after the second pass it is able to compute
                        <span class="math">\(a;\)</span>
                     and the third allows it to compute and incrementally parse
                        <span class="math">\(b.\)</span>
                     The maximum memory usage during this process would be 128 bytes plus two BLAKE2b hash states.</p>
                    <p>Since this streaming implementation of
                        <span class="math">\(\mathsf{F4Jumble}^{-1}\)</span>
                     is quite complicated, we do not require all Consumers to support streaming. If a Consumer implementation cannot support UAs / UVKs up to the maximum length, it MUST nevertheless support UAs / UVKs with
                        <span class="math">\(\ell_M\)</span>
                     of at least
                        <span class="math">\(256\)</span>
                     bytes. Note that this effectively defines two conformance levels to this specification. A full implementation will support UAs / UVKs up to the maximum length.</p>

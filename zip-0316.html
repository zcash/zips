            <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", and "SHOULD" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. <a id="id1" class="footnote_reference" href="#rfc2119">1</a></p>
            <p>The terms below are to be interpreted as follows:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Recipient</dt>
                <dd>A wallet or other software that can receive transfers of assets (such as ZEC) or in the future potentially other transaction-based state changes.</dd>
                <dt>Producer</dt>
                <dd>A wallet or other software that can create an Address (in which case it is normally also a Recipient) or a Viewing Key.</dd>
                <dt>Consumer</dt>
                <dd>A wallet or other software that can make use of an Address or Viewing Key that it is given.</dd>
                <dt>Sender</dt>
                <dd>A wallet or other software that can send transfers of assets, or other consensus state side-effects defined in future. Senders are a subset of Consumers.</dd>
                <dt>Receiver</dt>
                <dd>The necessary information to transfer an asset to a Recipient that generated that Receiver using a specific Transfer Protocol. Each Receiver is associated unambiguously with a specific Receiver Type, identified by an integer Typecode.</dd>
                <dt>Receiver Encoding</dt>
                <dd>An encoding of a Receiver as a byte sequence.</dd>
                <dt>Viewing Key</dt>
                <dd>The necessary information to view information about payments to an Address, or (in the case of a Full Viewing Key) from an Address. An Incoming Viewing Key can be derived from a Full Viewing Key, and an Address can be derived from an Incoming Viewing Key.</dd>
                <dt>Viewing Key Encoding</dt>
                <dd>An encoding of a Viewing Key as a byte sequence.</dd>
                <dt>Metadata Encoding</dt>
                <dd>An encoding of metadata that is not a Receiver or Viewing Key, but may affect the interpretation of the overall Unified Address/Viewing Key.</dd>
                <dt>Item</dt>
                <dd>An Receiver Encoding, Viewing Key Encoding, or Metadata Encoding.</dd>
                <dt>Legacy Address</dt>
                <dd>A Transparent, Sprout, or Sapling Address.</dd>
                <dt>Unified Address (or UA)</dt>
                <dd>A Unified Address combines multiple Receiver (and optionally Metadata) items.</dd>
                <dt>Unified Full Viewing Key (or UFVK)</dt>
                <dd>A Unified Full Viewing Key combines multiple Full Viewing Key (and optionally Metadata) items.</dd>
                <dt>Unified Incoming Viewing Key (or UIVK)</dt>
                <dd>A Unified Incoming Viewing Key combines multiple Incoming Viewing Key (and optionally Metadata) items.</dd>
                <dt>Unified Viewing Key</dt>

                <dd>Either a Legacy Address or a Unified Address.</dd>
                <dt>Transfer Protocol</dt>
                <dd>A specification of how a Sender can transfer assets to a Recipient. For example, the Transfer Protocol for a Sapling Receiver is the subset of the Zcash protocol required to successfully transfer ZEC using Sapling Spend/Output Transfers as specified in the Zcash Protocol Specification. (A single Zcash transaction can contain transfers of multiple Transfer Protocols. For example a t→z transaction that shields to the Sapling pool requires both Transparent and Sapling Transfer Protocols.)</dd>
                <dt>Address Encoding</dt>
                <dd>The externally visible encoding of an Address (e.g. as a string of characters or a QR code).</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Notation for sequences, conversions, and arithmetic operations follows the Zcash protocol specification <a id="id2" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-notation">3</a>.</p>

            <p>This proposal defines Unified Addresses, which bundle together Zcash Addresses of different types in a way that can be presented as a single Address Encoding. It also defines Unified Viewing Keys, which perform a similar function for Zcash viewing keys.</p>

        <section id="motivation"><h2><span class="section-heading">Motivation</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#motivation"><img width="24" height="24" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>Up to and including the Canopy network upgrade, Zcash supported the following Payment Address types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Transparent Addresses (P2PKH and P2SH)</li>
                <li>Sprout Addresses</li>
                <li>Sapling Addresses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these has its own Address Encodings, as a string and as a QR code. (Since the QR code is derivable from the string encoding, for many purposes it suffices to consider the string encoding.)</p>
            <p>The Orchard proposal <a id="id3" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0224">18</a> adds a new Address type, Orchard Addresses.</p>
            <p>The difficulty with defining new Address Encodings for each Address type, is that end-users are forced to be aware of the various types, and in particular which types are supported by a given Consumer or Recipient. In order to make sure that transfers are completed successfully, users may be forced to explicitly generate Addresses of different types and re-distribute encodings of them, which adds significant friction and cognitive overhead to understanding and using Zcash.</p>
            <p>The goals for a Unified Address standard are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simplify coordination between Recipients and Consumers by removing complexity from negotiating Address types.</li>
                <li>Provide a “bridging mechanism” to allow shielded wallets to successfully interact with conformant Transparent-Only wallets.</li>
                <li>Allow older conformant wallets to interact seamlessly with newer wallets.</li>
                <li>Enable users of newer wallets to upgrade to newer transaction technologies and/or pools while maintaining seamless interactions with counterparties using older wallets.</li>
                <li>Facilitate wallets to assume more sophisticated responsibilities for shielding and/or migrating user funds.</li>
                <li>Allow wallets to potentially develop new transfer mechanisms without underlying protocol changes.</li>
                <li>Support abstractions corresponding to a Unified Address that provide the functionality of Full Viewing Keys and Incoming Viewing Keys.</li>
                <li>Provide forward compatibility that is standard for all wallets across a range of potential future features. Some examples might include Layer 2 features, cross-chain interoperability and bridging, and decentralized exchange.</li>
                <li>Allow for Metadata items to be included in Unified Addresses/Viewing Keys in order to provide future extensibility.</li>
                <li>The standard should work well for Zcash today and upcoming potential upgrades, and also anticipate even broader use cases down the road such as cross-chain functionality.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>Unified Addresses specify multiple methods for payment to a Recipient's Wallet. The Sender's Wallet can then non-interactively select the method of payment.</p>
                <p>Importantly, any wallet can support Unified Addresses, even when that wallet only supports a subset of payment methods for receiving and/or sending.</p>
                <p>Despite having some similar characteristics, the Unified Address standard is orthogonal to Payment Request URIs <a id="id4" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0321">19</a> and similar schemes, and the Unified Address format is likely to be incorporated into such schemes as a new Address type.</p>

                <p>Wallets follow a model <em>Interaction Flow</em> as follows:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>A Producer <em>generates</em> an Address.</li>
                    <li>The Producer <em>encodes</em> the Address.</li>
                    <li>The Producer wallet or human user <em>distributes</em> this Address Encoding, This ZIP leaves distribution mechanisms out of scope.</li>
                    <li>A Consumer wallet or user <em>imports</em> the Address Encoding through any of a variety of mechanisms (QR Code scanning, Payment URIs, cut-and-paste, or “in-band” protocols like <code>Reply-To</code> memos).</li>
                    <li>A Consumer wallet <em>decodes</em> the Address Encoding and performs validity checks.</li>
                    <li>(Perhaps later in time) if the Consumer wallet is a Sender, it can execute a transfer of ZEC (or other assets or protocol state changes) to the Address.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Encodings of the same Address may be distributed zero or more times through different means. Zero or more Consumers may import Addresses. Zero or more of those (that are Senders) may execute a Transfer. A single Sender may execute multiple Transfers over time from a single import.</p>
                <p>Steps 1 to 5 inclusive also apply to Interaction Flows for Unified Full Viewing Keys and Unified Incoming Viewing Keys.</p>

                <p>A Unified Address (or UA for short) combines one or more Receivers.</p>
                <p>When new Transport Protocols are introduced to the Zcash protocol after Unified Addresses are standardized, those should introduce new Receiver Types but <em>not</em> different Address types outside of the UA standard. There needs to be a compelling reason to deviate from the standard, since the benefits of UA come precisely from their applicability across all new protocol upgrades.</p>

                <p>The string encoding is “opaque” to human readers: it does <em>not</em> allow visual identification of which Receivers or Receiver Types are present.</p>
                <p>The string encoding is resilient against typos, transcription errors, cut-and-paste errors, unanticipated truncation, or other anticipated UX hazards.</p>
                <p>There is a well-defined encoding of a Unified Address (or UFVK or UIVK) as a QR Code, which produces QR codes that are reasonably compact and robust.</p>
                <p>There is a well-defined transformation between the QR Code and string encodings in either direction.</p>
                <p>The string encoding fits into ZIP-321 Payment URIs <a id="id5" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0321">19</a> and general URIs without introducing parse ambiguities.</p>
                <p>The encoding must support sufficiently many Recipient Types to allow for reasonable future expansion.</p>
                <p>The encoding must allow all wallets to safely and correctly parse out unrecognized Receiver Types well enough to ignore them.</p>

                <p>When executing a Transfer the Sender selects a Receiver via a Selection process.</p>
                <p>Given a valid UA, Selection must treat any unrecognized Item as though it were absent.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This property is crucial for forward compatibility to ensure users who upgrade to newer protocols / UAs don't lose the ability to smoothly interact with older wallets.</li>
                    <li>This property is crucial for allowing Transparent-Only UA-Conformant wallets to interact with newer shielded wallets, removing a disincentive for adopting newer shielded wallets.</li>
                    <li>This property also allows Transparent-Only wallets to upgrade to shielded support without re-acquiring counterparty UAs. If they are re-acquired, the user flow and usability will be minimally disrupted.</li>

                <p>Rather than defining a Bech32 string encoding of Orchard Shielded Payment Addresses, we instead define a Unified Address format that is able to encode a set of Receivers of different types. This enables the Consumer of a Unified Address to choose the Receiver of the best type it supports, providing a better user experience as new Receiver Types are added in the future.</p>
                <p>Assume that we are given a set of one or more Receiver Encodings for distinct types. That is, the set may optionally contain one Receiver of each of the Receiver Types in the following fixed Priority List:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typecode
                        <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x03}\)</span>
                     — an Orchard raw address as defined in <a id="id9" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-orchardpaymentaddrencoding">7</a>;</li>
                    <li>Typecode
                        <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x02}\)</span>
                     — a Sapling raw address as defined in <a id="id10" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-saplingpaymentaddrencoding">6</a>;</li>
                    <li>Typecode
                        <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x01}\)</span>
                     — a Transparent P2SH address, <em>or</em> Typecode
                        <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x00}\)</span>
                     — a Transparent P2PKH address.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If, and only if, the user of a Producer or Consumer wallet explicitly opts into an experiment as described in <a href="#experimental-usage">Experimental Usage</a>, the specification of the experiment MAY include additions to the above Priority List (such additions SHOULD maintain the intent of preferring more recent shielded protocols).</p>
                <p>We say that a Receiver Type is “preferred” over another when it appears earlier in this Priority List (as potentially modified by experiments).</p>
                <p>The Sender of a payment to a Unified Address MUST use the Receiver of the most preferred Receiver Type that it supports from the set.</p>
                <p>For example, consider a wallet that supports sending funds to Orchard Receivers, and does not support sending to any Receiver Type that is preferred over Orchard. If that wallet is given a UA that includes an Orchard Receiver and possibly other Receivers, it MUST send to the Orchard Receiver.</p>
                <p>The raw encoding of a Unified Address is a concatenation of

                    <p>There is a generic brute force attack against near second preimage resistance. The adversary generates UAs at random with known keys, until one has an encoding that partially collides with one of the
                        <span class="math">\(q\)</span>
                     target Addresses. It may be possible to improve on this attack by making use of properties of checksums, etc.</p>
                    <p>The generic attack puts an upper bound on the achievable security: if it takes work
                        <span class="math">\(w\)</span>
                     to produce and verify a UA, and the size of the character set is
                        <span class="math">\(c,\)</span>
                     then the generic attack costs

c^{n+m}}{q}.\)</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>There is also a generic brute force attack against nonmalleability. The adversary modifies the target Address slightly and computes the corresponding decoding, then repeats until the decoding is valid and also useful to the adversary (e.g. it would lead to the Sender using a Transparent Address). With
                        <span class="math">\(w\)</span>
                     defined as above, the cost is
                        <span class="math">\(w/p\)</span>
                     where
                        <span class="math">\(p\)</span>
                     is the probability that a random decoding is of the required form.</p>

                    <p>In order to prevent the generic attack against nonmalleability, there needs to be some redundancy in the encoding. Therefore, the Producer of a Unified Address, UFVK, or UIVK appends the HRP, padded to 16 bytes with zero bytes, to the raw encoding, then applies

However, given that Unified Addresses may need to be produced on constrained computing platforms, this was not considered to be beneficial overall.</p>
                    <p>The padding contains the HRP so that the HRP has the same protection against malleation as the rest of the address. This may help against cross-network attacks, or attacks that confuse addresses with viewing keys.</p>

                    <p>The cost is dominated by 4 BLAKE2b compressions for
                        <span class="math">\(\ell_M \leq 128\)</span>
                     bytes. A UA containing a Transparent Address, a Sapling Address, and an Orchard Address, would have
                        <span class="math">\(\ell_M = 128\)</span>
                     bytes. The restriction to a single Address with a given Typecode (and at most one Transparent Address) means that this is also the maximum length as of NU5 activation.</p>
                    <p>For longer UAs (when other Typecodes are added), the cost increases to 6 BLAKE2b compressions for
                        <span class="math">\(128 &lt; \ell_M \leq 192,\)</span>
                     and 10 BLAKE2b compressions for
                        <span class="math">\(192 &lt; \ell_M \leq 256,\)</span>
                     for example. The maximum cost for which the algorithm is defined would be 196608 BLAKE2b compressions at
                        <span class="math">\(\ell_M = \ell^\mathsf{MAX}_M\)</span>
                     bytes.</p>
                    <p>A naïve implementation of the
                        <span class="math">\(\mathsf{F4Jumble}^{-1}\)</span>
                     function would require roughly
                        <span class="math">\(\ell_M\)</span>
                     bytes plus the size of a BLAKE2b hash state. However, it is possible to reduce this by streaming the
                        <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
                     part of the jumbled encoding three times from a less memory-constrained device. It is essential that the streamed value of
                        <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
                     is the same on each pass, which can be verified using a Message Authentication Code (with key held only by the Consumer) or collision-resistant hash function. After the first pass of
                        <span class="math">\(d\)</span>
                    , the implementation is able to compute
                        <span class="math">\(y;\)</span>
                     after the second pass it is able to compute
                        <span class="math">\(a;\)</span>
                     and the third allows it to compute and incrementally parse
                        <span class="math">\(b.\)</span>
                     The maximum memory usage during this process would be 128 bytes plus two BLAKE2b hash states.</p>
                    <p>Since this streaming implementation of
                        <span class="math">\(\mathsf{F4Jumble}^{-1}\)</span>
                     is quite complicated, we do not require all Consumers to support streaming. If a Consumer implementation cannot support UAs / UVKs up to the maximum length, it MUST nevertheless support UAs / UVKs with
                        <span class="math">\(\ell_M\)</span>
                     of at least
                        <span class="math">\(256\)</span>
                     bytes. Note that this effectively defines two conformance levels to this specification. A full implementation will support UAs / UVKs up to the maximum length.</p>

            <p>The terms "Testnet" and "Mainnet" are to be interpreted as described in section 3.12 of the Zcash Protocol Specification <a id="footnote-reference-3" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-networks">2</a>.</p>

            <p>This document proposes a new P2P message to gossip longer node addresses over the P2P network. This is required to support new-generation onion addresses, I2P, and potentially other networks that have longer endpoint addresses than fit in the 128 bits of the current <code>addr</code> message.</p>

            <p>Tor v3 onion services are part of the stable release of Tor since version 0.3.2.9. They have various advantages compared to the old v2 onion services, among which better encryption and privacy <a id="footnote-reference-4" class="footnote_reference" href="#tor-rendezvous-v3">9</a>. These services have 256-bit addresses and thus do not fit in the existing <code>addr</code> message (unchanged from Bitcoin <a id="footnote-reference-5" class="footnote_reference" href="#bitcoin-addr-message">7</a>), which encapsulates onion addresses in OnionCat IPv6 addresses.</p>
            <p>Other transport-layer protocols such as I2P have always used longer addresses. This change would make it possible to gossip such addresses over the P2P network, so that other peers can connect to them.</p>

            <p>The <code>addrv2</code> message is defined as a message where the <code>command</code> field is (NUL-padded) <code>"addrv2"</code>. It is serialized in the standard encoding for P2P messages. Its format is similar to the current <code>addr</code> message format described in <a id="footnote-reference-6" class="footnote_reference" href="#bitcoin-addr-message">7</a>, with the difference that the fixed 16-byte IP address is replaced by a network ID and a variable-length address, and the services format has been changed to <a id="footnote-reference-7" class="footnote_reference" href="#bitcoin-compactsize">8</a>.</p>
            <p>This means that the message contains a serialized vector of the following structure:</p>

            <p>Network ID <code>0x03</code> is intentionally not assigned. In BIP 155 <a id="footnote-reference-8" class="footnote_reference" href="#bip-0155">3</a> it was assigned to Tor v2 onion addresses, but those addresses are no longer supported by the latest Tor client code, and MUST NOT be used once this ZIP is deployed.</p>
            <p>Clients SHOULD gossip valid, potentially routable addresses from all known networks, even if they are currently not connected to some of them. That could help multi-homed nodes and make it more difficult for an observer to tell which networks a node is connected to.</p>
            <p>Clients MUST NOT gossip addresses from unknown networks, because they have no means to validate those addresses and so can be tricked to gossip invalid addresses.</p>
            <p>Clients MUST reject messages that contain addresses that have a different length than specified in this table for a specific network ID, as these are meaningless.</p>

            <p>This ZIP is closely based on BIP 155 <a id="footnote-reference-14" class="footnote_reference" href="#bip-0155">3</a>, with the following changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deployment: support for the <code>addrv2</code> message is signalled by advertising a peer protocol version of ${PLACEHOLDER} or higher, not by sending a <code>sendaddrv2</code> message. This is motivated by a desire to avoid an exponential explosion in the space of possible feature configurations in a given peer-to-peer connection. In Zcash, unlike Bitcoin, the space of such configurations is effectively constant no matter how many peer-to-peer protocol changes are made, because nodes that do not support a given peer protocol version will drop off the network over time if they do not support the latest Network Upgrade. The feature configuration for a given connection is also established at version negotiation, and cannot change after that point without reconnecting. Other peer-to-peer protocol changes ported from the Bitcoin peer-to-peer protocol, for example the <code>MSG_WTX</code> inv type defined in ZIP 239 <a id="footnote-reference-15" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0239">5</a>, have taken the same approach to signalling.</li>
                <li>No Network ID for Tor v2 onion addresses: the Tor network is expected to have removed support for these addresses in the timeframe for deployment of this ZIP.</li>
                <li>Clients MUST, rather than SHOULD, reject <code>addrv2</code> messages with more than 1,000 addresses. Making this a consistent requirement promotes interoperability.</li>
                <li>Clients MUST NOT, rather than SHOULD NOT, gossip addresses from unknown networks.</li>
                <li>Clients MUST, rather than SHOULD, reject messages that contain addresses that have a different length than specified for a known network ID, or a length greater than the 512-byte maximum for an unknown network ID.</li>
